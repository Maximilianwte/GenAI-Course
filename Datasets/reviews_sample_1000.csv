Scuderia Ferrari,"I purchased this and had to return it.  Could not get it to work to view on iphone, etc.  I have another dvr hooked up to the same router and works perfectly fine.  Customer service tried to troubleshoot it but was unsuccessful and told me that they would call me back to figure out the problem.  Never heard from them again.

In terms of overall quality, very cheap.  When viewing live footage on my mac, the resolution was terrible and there's no way to adjust it.  I called customer service yet again and they could not help as there were no adjustments.

Bryan,"I have a Delco Bose system in my 2004 Suburban and this thing worked well out of the box. It's really simple. Looking at the instructions really is not necessary. If I have any complaints using it with my Gen5 Vid iPod, output volume is weak and non-adjustable. A lot like a weak station on the dial. I have to really crank the radio volume in order to hear the iPod properly and if I switch to CD or another radio station while forgetting to turn down volume......BOOM!

Any handling/bumping of the slider causes static and potential loss of sound on one side or the other.

pros:
slim
speedy read and load times
easy easy set up
lots of nice little apps such as netflix and hulu+
the apple app is pretty nifty and very much in handy when inputting text, very very handy but.. (see cons)

cons:
youtube does not play official content, such as music videos from vevo.
same internet browser like the ps3; then again i never liked it

It will not connect to a Network Drive, so a computer connection is required, as-is leaving it ""on"" 24-7.

Easily holds my Samsung SBC-200 camera and since the camera position is adjustable inside the case there

As far as weather sealing the camera. If I added weather stripping or silicone, then I would also impeed the cooling

LeeRoy,"This is my first CB radio so take my comments with a bit of inexperience.

The knobs feel sturdy, the buttons feel sturdy,

The good:
Looks
Sturdy
Changes color
Comes with mount bracket, and mic holder

Cons/other
The SWR meter that is built in, I don't know how close to being right it is... when I first tested without trimming the antenna it was high, over two on some channels. I pulled it out around 1/4 inch, and now its basically perfect 1:1 on every channel, with a very small variation sometimes like 1.1.

I needed a radio that looked modern and would assist me in interstate travels, this has already proven itself.

UPDATE: 10 months of use
I have been using the BC daily for the last 10 months, first with a little wilson antenna which did a nice job, but I moved up to a Wilson 1000 which does a better job.
The radio still works great, everything still works and I have not had an issue with it, no do I have any complaints (this is a big deal).

I did send my Bearcat in to be ""peaked and tuned"" and is now swinging 30 watts on the bird meter with a 6 watt dead key. It has continued to work fantastic with daily use and has not failed me. I wish I could nit pick and find something that annoys me in daily use but I can't think of any.

Unimportant cons
LCD viewing angle is not friendly if mounted on the side of the center console.... but again there is little to no reason to ever look at it, you can see it fine at night also.
The beep when you turn the knob, again this only happens if you turn a knob or hit a button (the volume knob and squelch DO NOT beep). I rarely change channels, and the only time I hear the beep is if I change from day to night. It's really not annoying.

Random pros
The mic sounds good for stock, have had no complaints.",5,True,"08 25, 2012"
Amira,"I am really happy with this bluetooth case. I have had it for a few weeks now. The keyboard paired quickly with my kindle. There is a light that glows when charging the keyboard. I agree with some other reviewers that if you type fast on a normal keyboard, you may be put off by how these keys are not spaced far apart, but I am ok with it because I really prefer a physical keyboard as opposed to a virtual keyboard. I figure unless you are super fast at swype, you probably will type on this keyboard at about the same speed as if you used swype on the touch screen of your kindle. I don't use my kindle every day, but I have not had any problems with my kindle and the keyboard connecting. The kickstand is very sturdy. It can seems a little rigid when trying to fold down, but if you are careful with it, and not beat it down, it should last. I bought a micro usb adapter, and connected a wireless mouse to the kindle where the charging port is, so I was able to turn this into a mini pc. When closing the case, I have wondered if the keys would scratch the screen on the kindle. It hasn't done so, but I placed a micro fiber cloth on the screen just in case. I did buy a screen protector for the kindle, but haven't used it yet.",5,True,"05 15, 2015"

Androo,"These speakers get such rave reviews wherever you look that you'll expect them to be pretty amazing.

In many ways they are. They look amazing, for a start, all transparent and space age, and nicely built. The satellites look particularly good, and you can angle them easily. It's odd that the little blue globules inside the satellites don't light up like the ones in the subwoofer though.

The subwoofer is too good-looking to be hidden under a desk, but that's where the instructions recommend you put it.

There are rather a lot of wires: one for the power cord, one to your computer, another to the satellite connector, and then cables from that to the satellites themselves.

But it all worked once I plugged it in, and my immediate feeling was disappointment. I thought they sounded quite ragged. But... taking note of something I read, I let them play to themselves for a few hours. I also fiddled a lot with the volume controls (a knob on the subwoofer and a pair of annoying touch sensors on the base of one of the satellites).

Turn the volume on the sub above about ten percent and you get lots of bass, but none of it very nice. The resonances drown out bits of the music and sound awful. This may vary depending on your room and particularly your floor of course.

I'm used to a carefully set up, neutral-sounding hi-fi separates system. Some people suggest these speakers sound as good as a hi-fi - they don't. Nowhere near.

But once I'd set the sub and satellite volumes to my liking (the sub volume way, way down) they sounded pretty good.

Vocals are projected very strongly by the four drivers in the satellites, and for a lot of music this is quite a good thing. With the bass turned down, the sound is solid and focussed, and you're not too aware of the gap in the mid range. You do have to crank up the volume to get them to sound good though. At lower volumes they are quite weak. I suppose you could up the sub volume to compensate, but you really won't want to be crawling under your desk to do this all the time.

The last thing to mention is that the position and angle of the satellites is annoyingly critical. Even leaning to one side in your chair spoils the effect somewhat.

I'm not sure I totally recommend them, but they're not bad, and sometimes they're great. Because they're self powered, you can always take them elsewhere with your iPod so that adds versatility.

Try to listen before you buy.",4,False,"01 18, 2006"

Seems to be working again. I appreciate customer service that is prompt at communicating with customers!

It works exactly like it's supposed to: it converts a Display Port to allow HDMI.

Dominique,This is an excellent low price case.  I've used it for 6 months with no issues for running and gym time. I am on here to buy a second one because I was careless and clipped this to a thick uneven sweater while playing poker for 6 hours.  The clip will last if you are just using it for your normal workout gear but be careful if you're trying to use it on anything that's more than 3 under armour layers thick.  I think this is an overall great case.  Nothing lasts forever but this does a good job protecting the iPod.,4,True,"12 21, 2013"

Alco933,"I give the camera 3 stars but i give the software and web gui 2 stars. I have written my own surveillance cam softawre so I know this area pretty well.
The cam is good, clear, and I like the pan tilt. The angle is quite narrow so if you put it on your front porch you can't get a very good wide angle shot. Like in front of your door or them coming up to the door from 20 feet away but not both.
The web interaction is good.
The software is horrendous.
The settings are in about 4 different places and its hard to remember where I saw a particular setting every time i want to change one. Some are different in the web ui wich makes it even harder.
One big feature I am missing is some way for it to track movement with the pan/tilt when motion triggers an alarm. It does have programmable ""cruise"" and it does have a go to a predefined position after an alarm but then it stays there and there is no way to reset it automatically.
Likewise with uploading to a web site, you don't have much flexibility with that and the description of the upload settings is very confusing and scattered through out the software.
I am still getting pictures with incorrect times and not sure why even though it is supposedly synced to my computer.
I like the sound and motion detection capabilities but wish i had more options on what to do during motion detection like how long the video should record, or how many pictures to take, or the interval. There is some of that but very limited.
The night vision LED being on all the time makes the colors during the day look washed out. It should turn off in daylight ideally.

The padding is minimal, and the fit is too large for a 15"" macbook - since there's no rigidity to the fabric, it just poofed out and looked funny.

J. Massey,"Things to think about when getting headphones/earbuds:

A great review from a traveler who is a headphone stickler.

Short:

Pros: They sound great with good bass.

Cons: If you sing to yourself, phones that plug into your ears are not for you. The cord is very short- too short for me - at 5'8"".

Things to think about when getting headphones/earbuds:

If you want headphones to wear with a collared shirt:

1) You need headphones that are not connected. I founf the Nike Flight headphones to the best. I love them - great bass, cool looking, incognito, etc; but, the two ear pieces are connected by a behind the head band. If wearing a T-shirt, this is great. If wearing a collared shirt at the airport, everytime you turn your head, the rear band hits your collar and knocks the headphones off of your ears.

If you want to sing to yourself while wearing headphones/earbuds:

1) Don't buy in the ear type or ""plug type"" earbuds. They plug your ear and when you sing - it sounds like you are singing through your ears. Put your fingers all the way in your ears and sing and you will know what I mean. It takes all the fun out of singing as loud as you can in the rental car in the middle of podunt ohio.

If you wear headphone inside your shirt so they aren't seen.

1) When I travel, I put the headphones on inside my shirt, I string it down the onside of my shirt, up out of my pants, under my belt, and into my pocket where my ipod lives. The problem comes when the unit has a 1 meter cord. The 1 meter cord is too short by about 6"". I am 5'8"".",4,False,"02 5, 2006"

Amazon Customer,"The Apple TV is a very impressive solution that couples well with other Apple products.  If you can use AirPlay on any device (Apple or not), it should pair nicely with this.  It provides a very ""clean"" interface, and it's easy to rip videos (using Handbrake or similar) that will work on your iPhone / iPad which will also work on your AppleTVs.

As for the negative aspects of the product, it's similar to any other Apple product.  The biggest disadvantages to the product is a tradeoff for the impressive UI and hardware design--you won't be able to plug in a USB jump drive with an XviD encoded AVI on it and expect it to play.

HIHC,"This overpriced mouse is very-very....veeeery!!!! unreliable. It keeps disconnecting from my Laptop with Win 7 (when it connects). If you stop moving the mouse for a while, it disconnects. If the Laptop goes in standby the mouse won't connect automatically when it comes up again. The only way to re-connect the mouse is to go into the bluetooth devices list and double click on the mouse icon.... you'll get an error message (can't connect) but surprisingly it connects!.. I couldn't even pair it to my Lenovo Tablet 2 Win 8.

I also have the MS wegde bluetooth and that one works perfect. I decided to go for this one because the wedge is too small to use it permanently. I though Microsoft would use the same quality but I was fooled. I even though I've got a ""defective"" unit and exchange it through the excellent Amazon service (kudos for that!) but I got the same problem with the new one. It turned out that the previous unit was not defective, that's how it normal works (or ""not work"" I should say)!

One MS disappointing article!!!!. Honestly I was not expecting that.

I was hoping to give it a second chance and make an effort to work with it to see if eventually it would improve. Well, it didn't. It gets even worse.

honmaya,"I am by no means a camera expert or a photographer, but I do like to listen to their opinions when buying cameras. The S95 was reviewed very positively, and after having used it for 5 months, I can say that it's even better than what I expected.

First, it was much smaller than I thought it would be. Reading the dimensions is one thing, but when you actually are able to hold this camera, you can truly appreciate how portable it really is, about the size of a pack of cigarettes would be about right. It is very, very solid, you can tell that it was built to last and the finish is very understated, which is what I prefer. One thing about the size though, if you have large hands, it may be challenging to grip the camera comfortably each time, especially when you are trying to do it quickly.

The picture quality is I think outstanding. I'm sure the pictures would look even better if I knew how to properly take pictures, but using the P mode, the images look natural and great pretty much every time. Despite being on the lower side in terms of megapixels, the images have a good amount of detail, and with the fast lens, low light pictures have significantly better results. There is also aperture and shutter priority modes, so you can experiment, or even use full manual. The lens is very flush to the body, and will jut out when the camera is on and ready to take pictures. But what I thought was a cool feature was the adjustable ring around the lens, you can set this to do one of several functions, and it works very well.

Overall an excellent camera and an excellent value.",5,False,"05 3, 2011"
Dave Cunningham,"I've owned Dells for more than a decade and like them, and I've also owned ASUS and Acer laptops. For my money, this Dell Inspiron 15 is a fair bargain and a competent workhorse.

The only significant drawback to this laptop, for me, is the keyboard. I'm a writer, I type all day long, and for my desktop PC (also a Dell), I have a Logitech ergonomic wireless keyboard with real raised ""clicking"" keys and a padded wrist rest, and it has spoiled me. The Dell Inspiron 15 has your typical laptop keyboard with quiet little flat keys that barely rise above the surface, and your wrists rest on either side of the large touchpad. If you do most of your laptop stuff with a mouse and touchpad and only use the keys for email or Facebook posts, the keyboard should be fine for you.

I like the large (for a laptop) screen, the thin and light profile, the 3.0 USB ports, and most of all, the CD/DVD disc drive. It's something that has disappeared from a lot of laptops, so that's a big selling point. I find the processor speed (2GHz) plenty fast for how I use it (I'm not a gamer). The HDD capacity (500GB) and RAM (4GB) are more than sufficient.

I did experience a bit of a learning curve with the touchpad, but once you test-drive it for a while, it's fine. It responds to taps and well as clicks, is divided into right and left sides, and has dead spots at the top (less responsive). Once you embed in your brain's auto-pilot where the best click and tap spots are, you cease to think about it.

My desktop (Dell XPS 27) has a touchscreen, so when I switch to the laptop -- which runs the same Windows 8.1 OS -- I find myself touching and tapping the screen out of habit. The Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 15.6-inch laptop does NOT come with touch screen. I use mouse clicks and keyboard strokes for 90% of my work anyway, so when I reflexively tap or swipe the screen, I'm always surprised for a second that nothing happens. Also, the laptop screen resolution tops out at 1366x768, while my desktop 27-inch screen is nearly twice as sharp, 2560x1440. So I do notice a difference in clarity.

If you want touchscreen or super-HD, move up to the next laptop level. But all things considered, this is a good machine. I have it connected to my home wireless network, and my wife and I both use it.",4,False,"05 8, 2015"

This HDMI switch beats them all. Not only does it include a cable to run into your TV, but it also automatically switches devices, depending on which one is sending a signal. If you're running two or more devices simultaneously, naturally it's going to make a call as to which one to choose; in that case you can manually change it yourself.

Bryon,"It took less than a year but the speaker stopped working. I connected my phone via bluetooth like I do every morning, and it was super quiet. I turned up the volume and I got nothing but static. Then I realized it was not static but the speaker distorting the sound, making it unlistenable.

I do not recommend this speaker. It just doesn't last long enough.

edit: Saw that there is a one year warranty, will contact the manufacturer and see what happens. I will update my review after I see what happens.

[UPDATE]

I contacted the manufacturer and they had awesome customer service. I sent them my receipt along with a picture of the product and they sent me a replacement. It wasn't blue, that model is out of stock, but I got a red one.

Two complaints: The red one costs $10 less than the blue one on Amazon so I feel a little ripped off, but just a little. Second, the replacement still has some issue with static and I feel I can't turn the volume all the way up without some distortion. Maybe it's the music files, I know some are louder than others, so again I only feel a little bad about it.

I love the JAM speaker they make, sounds wonderful with all my music. This one is definitely a step down but it works and sounds better than my phone or laptop's built in speakers. And man their customer service is great, reminds me of my place of business; quick and courteous, and wanting to satisfy the customer.

I am upgrading my rating from 1 star to 3 because of the customer service and the fact that the replacement works. I would have done 4 stars if they had blue to send me, as I said above I feel just a little ripped off. I will keep using it and update if needed.",3,True,"07 4, 2016"

yep,"This is a heavy-duty, heavy-gauge cable that has no trouble driving my 1,000 watt bass cab. The sound and power are clean, clear, and high-headroom, even with a rig that will trip some residential circuit-breakers at peak volume. The connectors lock tight in place, and the strain-relief is legit.

So why so cheap? Well, the obvious compromise is the connectors. These are not precision Neutrik plugs, rather they are cheaply-made stamped-plastic no-name connectors. But God bless Neutrik, they designed the SpeakOn standard so well that even dimestore junk makes a solid and immobile physical connection.

Do I trust this cable to power the huge Ampeg rig in my studio live room? Absolutely. That stuff will sit there until Doomsday, and here are some heavy-metal conductors to ship electrons from amp to speaker.

Would I trust this on tour? Probably not. The plugs make a solid connection, but are cheaply made.

John R,"Hi,
In my quest for something to protect my iPhone from water and sand I've tried a few different products.  The two most robust are this Armband case and the Pelican i1015 Case.  The Pelican i1015 Black Case is also currently available from Amazon.  It might be something to consider depending on how you intend to use them.

Although both products are designed to keep your iPhone dry they differ considerably in construction and purpose.  Each has its merits and I'll run through a few of them.

- Both generally provide good protection from water.  They seal well and the latches are secure.  I do think the Pelican is stronger in this area though.

- The Pelican is far more crush proof.  If you plan on throwing your phone in a dry bag with all your gear and taking it on a rafting or kayaking trip it's a solid choice.

- The H20 Armband is constructed primarily of wetsuit material.  It offers a measure of padding particularly on the sides and back.  However, the front of the phone is covered by a thin sheet of transparent vinyl.  Gear rubbing against it could easily damage or tear the vinyl and damage the iPhone.

- The best thing about the H20 armband is you can operate the touch screen while it's in the case.  Voice control will only get you so far.  If you want to read your email or check sports scores you need more than voice control.

- The Pelican has a little bit of room for additional storage.  Though there isn't a great deal of space it's enough to fit in your ear-buds, a key or two, and some cash.  The armband has very little extra space.

- The H20 Armband is a very tight squeeze for the iPhone.  I always worry about getting the phone in and out of the case without harming it.

- The Pelican case is considerably less expensive.  You can get two or three or them for what the armband costs.

It really comes down to your intended applications.  Ignoring the price difference if you want something primarily for listening to music and providing excellent storage the Pelican is great.  It's not really suitable for swimming or surfing though.

If you want a case that will allow you to use all the features of your phone during your aquatic activities the H20 Armband is the winner in my opinion.  Between the two of them it's certainly the way to go for swimming and surfing.

John",3,False,"01 7, 2011"

The aluminum housing is very durable, you don't have to worry abou losing the cap or bending the USB connector, and it has a nice ring to easily keep it on a keychain or carabiner.

Again, this thing isn't going to win any races, but  it at least reads quite a bit faster than a USB 2.0 drive. It's a great design and one of the few I don't have to worry about breaking or losing.

CC Hunt,"The Sony BDPS3200 Blu-ray Disk Player plays Blu-ray disks and standard DVDs with no discernible difference from any other similar device I've tried. The reason I bought this model was that it would also stream Amazon Prime video thus allowing me to add versatility to my TV that has just two HDMI connections. Sadly, the player cuts off the last minute or two of every Amazon Prime video I've watched. Combine this with what Sony thinks is a convenient, easy-to-use interface but instead is a clunky big of kludge that resembles what 1970s designers thought a 21st Century interface would look like and the value of my purchase drops considerably.

I haven't tried the other online services. I hope they are faster to connect with fewer steps that the Amazon Prime option. Most are services I've don't recognize and those that I do recognize have no value to me. I am probably going to subscribe to Netflix once I disconnect from Comcast TV services so hopefully it functions well.

If you like to stack your electronics, this unit must be on top due to its flimsy, sloped top surface. This is noted in other reviews but I bought it anyway as I don't stack.

Lie2me,"I purchased this router in early 2013 and finally got around to setting it up.
It had hardware version A1 and Firmware version 1.02 so I may have missed a bunch of bugs experience by early adopters.
There presently is a firmware upgrade to FM 1.04 that I have yet to install.
Waiting for an email from support of whether the zip or bin file type needs to be used.

I have used a number of routers over the past 10-15 years.
The longest being a Dlink  DGL-4100 that had its wall wart fail but not the router itself.  They stopped upgrading software so felt it was time to change.
I have used an Airport Extreme router from Apple and an older wireless router from Netgear and briefly a SonicWall router.

I have been using Apple Mac computers/ipad/iphone at home with these routers.
If you are looking for the easiest to setup for an Apple Mac, I would recommend Apple's Airport Extreme.
However, Apple's does not have quite as many features as this Dlink router which you may or may not even use.

This Dlink 857 router is a little more difficult to setup for Mac users.  You do a manual setup because the CD and its software are PC based.
You really want to follow the quick start guidelines carefully.  I found the power button was insufficient to reconnect the router.  Be sure to pull the power cord when trying to re-establish the connection to the router.  That will allow you to get back to using the IP address into the router.  Thereafter the router will reboot itself AOK.

I found the reboot time for the router to take a long time.  It is easier to change settings and save them, then reboot at the end.
After getting this router up and running, I had to power down/restart all the equipment to get proper connections made to the internet through it.

I really wanted to mount this unit against a wall because it takes up space when laying flat.
I gave it 4 stars because it lacks screw hole cavities on its bottom side to mount it vertically.
My old Dlink had these and also had a stand to stand it up vertically.
If you want to mount this vertically, you will need to figure out that on your own.

I hope this router will last for 5-7 years as my trusty DGL-4100 did.

Buckeye,"Picked this up clearanced out at a very well known toy store for $55.00 and for that price this thing can't be beat. But honestly listening to the competition costing twice that much this thing still shines with it's good sound to small footprint ratio.  The sound is very clear with my iphone EQ set to Rock which emphasizes lows and highs. Also, Slacker and Pandora sound very good as well.  Others have commented on base reproduction but I think a more accurate way to describe it would be mid-base.  This thing is great for small rooms or an office. I have mine in the kitchen and I can hear it fine while washing dishes, cooking, and running the dishwasher.  I have played this thing very loud with little to no distortion,(Blues, Jazz, and Rock mostly).  Having realistic expectations is the key as this thing is NOT a stereo replacement or a thumping base machine.
The few cons are that the iphone adapter is limited if you have any kind of case on your phone.  I am able to connect my iphone 4 and my wife's 3g, both with cases, without the provided adapter and have no fear of the connector giving way.  The remote is also a little slow to respond at times while navigating the menu but does well most of the time with simple volume and song advance/previous inputs.
You can't go wrong with this little guy if you keep realistic expectations in the forefront of your purchase decision making.  If bigger sound is require you can step up to the sound stage 400p which also has excellent reviews.

I have another Bluetooth headset (the one that sits on your shoulder) & it doesn't show battery life even though it actually tells you when battery low but that recording comes within a short time of it dying so that feature is a plus for me.

Silicon Valley Geek,"Purchased the Samsung Series 5 550 3G model because it allowed 2 years free access on Verizon's 3G network.  I was amazed at how after turning it on, selecting our WiFi network and password that my kids could log right into their school's account in a matter of seconds!

St Leo the Great of San Jose has all the students using chromebooks.  Each student is issued their own school email address and password.  All their school work is saved in Google docs and on Google drive (cloud based).  All their email, homework, calendar, video lessons, etc. are available.

We debated between a MacBook Air, a Windows laptop or a Chromebook.  Overall I'm happy we went with the Chromebook.  There are cheaper Windows laptops out there, and some folks find the WiFi is more stable and the web browser is faster, but for our needs and to keep our kids from having to deal with administering a Windows machine it made sense to pay a premium and go with a Chromebook.

Since a Chromebook is basically useless without an internet connection going with the 3G and 2 years free 100mb a month option made sense.  If you use more than 100mb a month you can buy more ($10 for an unlimited day pass).  This is useful if they are working on homework in the car or at a friend's house without WiFi access.  Your 2 year period starts once you configure it in settings (about a 15 min. registration setup - you can configure it by going to the lower right hand corner, choosing your google login icon, select settings and in Internet connection choose mobile data, activate Verizion Wireless).

The coolest thing is that anyone can walk up to a Chromebook and if they have a Gmail account (or a school account that uses Google like Bellarmine or St Leo) they can log in.  Everything is stored online and the browser window leaves off right where you left it.

A couple of items to point out (see product photos I uploaded):
- The AC power cord to brick connector isn't flush.  Not a big deal, but it looks sloppy when you don't get a tight fit.  The power brick has a useful green LED to let you know it is plugged in.
- The power tip connector to the laptop isn't flush either.  You do get an amber light on the laptop to show you it is charging, but I do wish Apple would give better licensing terms for their patented magnet power adapter  (magsafe) connection.  I can totally see this small Samsung power tip bending or sending the chromebook flying if someone trips over the power cord.
- The trackpad is large and works better than previous models.  It doesn't have Apple's multi-gesture shortcuts and the scroll direction is the opposite of what I like but that can be changed in the trackpad preferences.
- The keyboard doesn't have a caps lock key (they put a google search magnifier) but you can use shift+magnifier to toggle caps lock function ON/OFF.  The keyboard isn't backlighted.
- The screen has a dull matte non-glass finish which is better for reading (not too many reflections).  The screen size is small at 12.1 inch LCD at WXGA 1280x768 resolution.
- Video out is via the full size displayport connector.  I wish Samsung had put a HDMI connector instead.  You'll need to buy a full size displayport to VGA, DVI or HDMI connector for your video output needs.  If you use DVI or VGA you'll also need to buy an mini-jack 1/8"" standard audio cable.

- You should take the time to learn the keyboard shortcuts for the Chrome OS.  Hit Ctrl+Alt+? to bring up a graphical map of the keyboard and all the useful shortcuts.
- You may get intermittent trying to connect messages inside a Google Docs that locks you out of the document for a few seconds.  I've never noticed this when using the same google doc on a Mac or PC laptop so I'm not sure if this is a Chromebook WiFi adapter issue.  The chromebook has built in gigabit ethernet CAT 6 cable connector so that may be more stable if you run into this too.
- The boot up time for a Chromebook is fast! The Chrome browser however is slower than a Chrome browser on your Mac or PC when loading pages.  Hopefully this will improve as Google learns how to optimize their Chrome OS.
- Printing is a pain.  Your best bet is to buy a Goolge Cloud compatible printer.  Our HP Envy 110 printer was already Mac Airprint compatible and worked well with the Chromebook.  These new cloud based printers use an email address for your printer so technically you could just email it if all else fails.  Google Cloud Print is tied to a primary Google account that then shares the printer with other users, so be sure to set it up with your primary Google account first.  Lower left corner, select your profile icon and choose settings, choose show advance settings and select Open Google Cloud Printer.
- Scanning is also a pain.  Your best bet is that same Google Cloud compatible printer will also allow you to type in your printer's TCPIP address and load a web based scanner utility that you can use to scan a photo into the Chrome browser.  You can then Control+click the image to get the option to do a save image to your Google drive.  In our case our HP envy resets it's IP address every time the router reboots so I'll need to hardcode it's IP address and then save it as a bookmark in the browser to make it easier to access.
- The Goolge Chromebook comes with a built in camera for video conferencing across Google Talk and Google+ Hangouts.  You can also use Evernote to use it to capture images as a poor man scanner with OCR detection!
- Battery life is awesome.  6+ hours on a full charge.
- Plugging an SD card into the slot brings up a folder drive icon and you can copy whatever images you want over to Google Drive.
- Kensington security lock hole makes securing your Chromebook a no brainer.  Why Apple dropped this off the MacBook Air makes no sense.  That said, a Macbooks have the Find my iPhone app that also tracks your Mac's location.  The Chromebook has no current method for tracking stolen Chromebooks (something that probably happens frequently at schools).  The good thing is that any data is encrypted on the Chromebook and that you can access all your work on any Chromebook with an Internet connection.
- I wish the Chromebook had USB 3, but that said I haven't really connected any USB devices to it yet anyways!

If this review helped give it a thumbs up, if not feel free to add your gripe in the comments.  Chromebooks aren't for everyone, but I'm amazed at how the challenge of having to always have an internet connection is offset by the wonderful ease of use of cloud based computing.",4,True,"10 8, 2012"

Wally Waffles,"Using this off-brand keyboard for a few days fixed the official name-brand keyboard.  I know this is a ridiculous claim, but here's what happened:

At work we have an iMac for secondary purposes (such as making sure stuff also works on iOS and watching Netflix).  It doesn't get used much, but it is beyond its warranty.  The $50+ official Macintosh keyboard that came with it one day suddenly stopped responding to presses of the spacebar.  (Everything else still worked.)  I removed, cleaned, and reattached the spacebar a few times, and also rebooted the machine several times, but the spacebar would not start working again.  (Apparently spacebar failure is very common in official Macintosh keyboards.)

For the sake of typing the space character, I hooked up a for-Windows PC USB keyboard that I bought at the second-hand thrift store for a whole dollar.  I also reattached the original Mac keyboard for the usefulness of its extra buttons such as the volume controls.  This was an acceptable arrangement for a while, but then the Mac spacebar started to get and remain ""stuck,"" even after I fully removed the physical key.  (The experienced effect was that web pages would scroll all the way down, because that's what typically happens when you hammer the spacebar when no input field has focus.  Netflix playback also experienced seizures because the spacebar pauses and resumes videos.)

I detached the fancy-pants aluminum keyboard because of its latest malfunction, leaving us with just the plain ol' PC keyboard.  Again, this was a mostly acceptable solution, but we eventually decided we should get an operating-system-appropriate keyboard since the Windows key doesn't behave like the Quatrefoil key and the PC F[unction] keys don't do any of the extra stuff that the Mac F[unction] keys do, so we ordered this one for $20.

After a few days of use, I was about to put away the old Mac keyboard when I thought of trying one more test:  I went to keyboardtester-dot-com, plugged in the old keyboard and started mashing keys.  To my surprise, the spacebar was working properly again!

We put this new keyboard back in its box and we're holding on to it as an emergency backup, but unless the official Mac keyboard craps out again, we'll probably never ever use it again (for lack of need).

By the way, this ""Macally 103 Key Full-Size USB Keyboard with Short-Cut Keys for Mac"" isn't really full-size; it's about an inch narrower than an actual ""full-size"" keyboard, which is achieved by smooshing the arrow keys and the six above between the main keys and the num pad, so its actually a ""compact keyboard (with num pad).""

The keys are comfortable to press, but one person said she kept getting confused by the compact arrangement of the arrows and the six above.  I should knock a star off for this, but this product earns an extra 10 stars for A) having a functioning spacebar, B) fixing the other keyboard, and C) not being *incredibly* overpriced like everything else for Mac is.",5,True,"10 15, 2015"
I. Fetterley,"I bought + resold a dedicated slide/negative digitizer as I found the software difficult to use.  This small-ish adapter allows me to use my Nikon camera and my standard process to edit the results.  It works as delivered for slides - some barrel distortion due to the included close-up lens, but easy to correct while doing fade/light/etc corrections.  When used with my standard 50mm prime lens (threads fit without adaptors), I found it best to use a small aperture in order for the focus to work on possibly-warped slides.  This meant that the shutter speed went from a few seconds in good inside lighting (needed more color correction) to 1/30 with outside daylight typically (more/less for darker/lighter slides).  Slow shutter speed was not a problem as nothing moves relatively during each shot unless you are careless!

I was able to dismantle the slide tray and, using a sharp knife, shave some plastic from one half (and chamfer some edges on the other half) to allow inserting a strip of negatives.  While fiddly, and not perfect, I did shoot 1000+ negatives this way and then did color inversion and correction in my editing software - dust/dirt is a problem (use cotton gloves) but that is no different for any other converter.  Plus, the mod does not affect its use with slides.

There are some weakness with the design (alignment always need correction - different for each slide as the tray's weight changes the angle - again correctable when editing).  The spring-loaded indent system does not stay adjusted for long.  The opening shape only fits 35mm slides - older 127 slide (or larger) only show a portion - the 127's can be fully used if you file a small U shape from top/bottom of the opening, but that does cause a bit more handling problems if you also do the negative ""mod"".

With my standard 50mm lens, I get about 75% of the frame used in each direction (about 50% of the total pixels).  So, a 12mb picture will be about 6mb.  If you use a macro and conversion rings, you can do better.  But, my old slides had enough grain/noise that 6mb seemed reasonable.

But, I have used it a lot and it still works the same.  It's price seems a little high for what it is, but it is 30% of the cheapest decent dedicated slide digitizer.  The tube assembly is all metal/glass, and the slide tray is plastic (8 screws holding 2 halves together). And it does not take up any more computer desk space or USB ports!",4,True,"12 11, 2012"

yuki,"While not the worst mouse I have ever owned, the T630 is very much on the top of my bad mice list.

So I was looking for a mouse to go with my new mac mini and new apple magic touch pad. The Apple magic touch pad is an awesome device for most tasks but one still need a true mouse for things like minecraft and lightroom. So I was looking at the Apple magic mouse, but in the end I chose the T630 since it was built better and felt a little more resistant to scratches. The build quality is not bad at all with the t630 and it does have some nice features, but overall it just sucks.

Let me start with the good. The materials are good and the assembly is solid and it does feel like it will last over the years of use (if you want to use it that is). Bluetooth connectivity is easy and it stays connected to my mac mini. I also had luck of it connecting to my nexus 7 and nook hd. The neat thing about pairing it to 2 devices is you can switch between the pairing profiles via a physical switch at the bottom. One switch position could be a tablet and the other a desktop. Just switch between the 2 and you do not have to re-pair with the 2 devices. It also does seems to be fairly responsive and it tracks on most surfaces well.

So on to the bad, oh so much to say about why it is so bad... I am going to start out first with the location of the micro usb charging port. Why at the bottom ? I have had other usb rechargeable mice from Logitech that had the charging port at a location that allows you to use it while it charges. Also it being at the bottom makes it collect lint from a mouse pad or such surface. As said the charging port location make it impossible to use while charging, yes they say 1 minute will give you 1 hour, and it does seem to give you a bit of time. But you know why at the bottom ? I would be less picky if the thing actually had over 8 hours of battery life! Yeah I get about 8 hours , some people say 10 or 12. Sometimes I forget to charge it so it would be nice to at least have the ability to charge and use it at the same time.

The gestures just plain suck if you use ones for over 1 finger. Multi-finger swipes do not register well and are way to inconsistent to be useful. I have already Returned this for another t630 thinking it might have a defect. Nope the gestures just do not register. And it is just not me, had 2 other people try it out. They constantly had the issues of the swipes not registering. The scroll wheel emulation and inertial scrolling are just bad, not healthy medium like the t400 for example or the official Apple magic touchpad. The ergonomics are the real kicked. Yes it looks nice and feels nice but it just hurts after an hour or more of use. The mouse is just too small for comfortable use.

So yeah look another place for a usable mouse !",2,False,"11 14, 2013"

Keay Rhyasen,"I bought this card because the Gigabyte/AMD mobo, apu and memory bundle advertisement stated you could go crossfire mode with ANY (without an * ) AMD 6xxx series graphics card.  installing the HD6670 and not being able to get into crossfire, I found out the A4 apu can ONLY crossfire with the 6450 cards so I bought one to see what the difference would be.  after installing it and getting into crossfire I was severely disappointed in the performance of my machine.  the windows experience dropped from the 5.8 it had been using the HD 6670 as a stand alone card down to 3.8 with the 6450 crossfired with the mobo's integrated graphics.  needless to say, the 6450 went back into the packaging it came in and will be saved as a spare for someone else's computer.

for a cheap card and in my cheap gaming rig (only spent about $200USD), I am more than impressed.  I am able to play the online MMO's I could no longer play on my intel rig which i built in 2001 with the P4 3.06 HT cpu and it could no longer process todays instructions.

I would give this card a five star rating just because it pairs well with the Gigabyte MoBo and AMD apu combo BUT... to crossfire,  the ad said ANY 6 Series card and this wasn't true.  is not the card's fault but either Gigabyte, AMD or Amazon.  it worked out well for me (other than buying the 6450 card after the fact) because I might have sworn off Gigabyte and AMD forever had I tried the 6450 first.  maybe the advertisements need to be a little bit more clearer when issues like this are possible?",4,True,"03 13, 2013"

KC,"I had 2 of these monitors and both had a couple of stuck pixels. The first one had a big bright green stuck pixel which was really noticeable even on light background. The second one had a few small green ones that were only noticeable on a dark background and if you knew where to look. They both had minor backlight bleed that was pretty noticeable on black background. The blacks on these monitors also look kinda dark navy blue.

I just want to point out that no matter which monitor you get, you're always going to have a couple of stuck pixels if you look hard enough. And once you find that stuck pixel, it can never be unseen. You'll find yourself fixated on it even when its not that apparent. I went through 4 27inch monitors (x2 Asus VE278Q, x1 Dell S2740L, x1 ViewSonic VX2770SMH) and I was able to find stuck pixel(s) on all of them.

J. Hansen,"Having grown up in a musical home, with a composer/arranger as a father, I've been around good speakers and headphones for a great deal of my life. Having been in this situation, I found the quality of these headphones to be so-so. They're a little overpriced for what you get, and are probably worth more about $40 versus $80. The fancy, patented noise canceling technology doesn't really have much affect on the overall noise canceling experience. You'd have just as much noise cancelation by simply sticking two glass cups around your ears. With these headphones that's handled by the foam headphones that cover your ears, and, eventually, get very uncomfortable.

That being said, they do work. You don't hear much noise, so they do achieve their purpose. The design is also quite impressive, to some extent. I personally really liked how they designed the cable (which is a mediocre grade cable) and how it inserts itself into the headphones. The battery compartment is also quite nice, although I felt the flap was a little flimsy, and it wasn't immediately obvious that's where the battery needed to be inserted.

Amazon Customer,"This is not a very good headset.
The reasons:
- The overall quality is marginal to poor.  The first test was to leave a message and listen to it both on a landline and via the headset.  Not good recording and the audio from the headset was poor, as well.
- There doesn't appear to be any ""noise reduction.""  The noise-reduction microphone was tested with moderate background noise.  It did nothing to reduce the background noise.  By comparison, using a gaming headset (wired) with noise reducing microphone eliminated nearly all of the background noise.
- To charge the headset requires the special stand and a unique ""non-micro"" USB cable.  The cable has a form factor similar to a micro USB, but it has a connector.  So, if either the charger base or cable are misplaced, the headset cannot be charged.
- It has an unusual earpiece without any illustration that explains the details of wearing the headset.

KevinBellamy,"I ordered one of these during late-2012 and it was shipped via Amazon.com LLC as an Add-on Item.
The cleaner pictured here on this page is different from the original model I received.

The first model, I'll give 5 stars because it worked(s) on two VCR's with no hassle or issues what-so-ever. I actually gave that model to a friend to have and decided to buy a second cleaner for myself, right? Sadly, the model I received today is entirely different from the original model.
The tape would not operate either hence the low score.

There's no instructions needed to operate these - Put cleaner in, press play, tape plays for 15-20 seconds, rewinds then ejects. Easy, eh?

J. Young,"I did pre-order the new iPad and it did arrive today. Like with any device I buy, I spend way too much time searching for ""the case"".  I love leather and this Piel Frama is made of very nice leather. Well, at least I think so. It feels nice in the hands.

The new iPad inserted into and it fits like a glove. There is a leather flap that wraps around the end of the iPad in the location you inserted it into the case. I would assume this is to hold it in there to keep it from falling out.  I held it in portrait and shook very violently and the iPad stayed in just fine.

This is a lot of money, but it is protecting and wrapped around something that costs a lot of money. So at least in my opinion, it is worth it if you like this style of case and if you like leather. This case will add some weight when you carry the iPad.",5,True,"03 16, 2012"

James Duckett,"I have been a big fan of the Rio hard drive MP3 players having owned a 1.5GB Nitrus for over a year and have played with the quite similar 20GB Karma for a while.  I loved my Nitrus, but my biggest complaint was that I wished there were just a bit more room.  The second I saw the 5GB Carbon, which is roughly the same size as the Nitrus, I knew I had to have it.  When my Nitrus broke, it turned into an opportunity to get a Carbon.

On a side note, hard drive mp3 players apparently do not survive 20 foot drops very well.  But I digress.

Pluses:

1)  The size!!!  Like the Nitrus, this is still the largest benefit.  It is smaller and lighter than the 4GB Mini-Ipod and about the same size as the Nitrus.  I can carry it in any pocket with no problems.  Not only is it small, but it is very lightweight.  I don't even notice it being in my pocket.

2)  The capacity!!  The Nitrus held 1.5GB, which was pretty decent.  The larger I-Pod Mini holds 4GB, which is obviously better.  But this puppy holds 5GB.  Right now is has four different music playlists and four books and I've barely put a dent into the amount of space it holds.  All this in a little-itty bitty package.  Brilliant!

3)  Volume control.  The Nitrus had two flimsy-feeling buttons.  Now you use the scrolling wheel.  This is so much easier, especially while wearing gloves or fidgeting through a case.

4)  The battery.  My old Nitrus ran forever, and now the Carbon runs even longer.  I rarely run out of battery on my Nitrus (I just had to charge it once every few days) and I've yet to run out on the Carbon.  I do hit the road often and it is nice to not have to tote a power cord everywhere I go for it.

Mixed Reviews:

1)  Voice recorder.  This would be great if there were a quick and easy way to make recordings.  Instead, you need to go through the menuing system and even then it takes a bit for it to start recording.  If you wish to make a quick note, it'd be faster to grab a sticky pad.  And the results aren't that fantastic.  It is really hard to figure out the perfect distance to get a good recording as it offers no feedback on audio recording levels (it's always too much or too little, never just right).

2)  USB.  You now use the USB to charge the Carbon and to upload/modify music selections.  However, the USB must carry a certain amount of power.  This renders my laptop unable to transfer the files or even synchronize.  But, when the Carbon is attached to my computer and is idle, my computer will actually charge the battery.  An annoying drawback is that when you plug in the power, the Carbon doesn't know if it is power or a computer hookup so it will power on.  Many a times I've hooked it up to power it and then come over to find it running.  Instead, you need to hang around awhile and make sure to turn it off afterwards.

3)  The case.  I almost put this in the negative column but since the Nitrus didn't even include a case, I decided to move it into mixed.  This is not really much of a case, though, but more of a protective covering.  You can't attach it to anything like a belt clip, so be prepared to buy a new case for this.  Believe me, you'll want it (please see earlier reference to 20 foot drop).  But I use the included case with my newly purchased case.  If you look at their online manual, the case actually looks nice.  Too bad the one depicted there wasn't shipped with the Carbon.

Negatives:

1)  Support.  Their web site is lousy while trying to get answers.  Software updates are a breeze, I'll give them that, but I can't figure out anything else.  It is nearly impossible to get a live body to lend a hand in times of need.  And as somebody else pointed out, this only comes with a 90 day warranty... though my Nitrus lasted over a year with no problems, except the lack of a parachute.

2)  Playlists:  You can only make them at the computer and they can often be difficult to make correctly (I often listen to audio books so they MUST be in a certain order).  I hate being on the road when I realize that the books got jumbled up.  This is also a big complaint of my mother's, who also owns a Rio.

3)  The cover:  The stainless steel looks awesome, but with certain headphones I get a lot of static.  Including their own earbuds!!!  Talk about a major oversight.  How annoying.

In the end, I would highly recommend this over any other player if you are looking for something in the 5GB size.  If you actually need 20GB, look at the Rio Karma.  That is a fine piece of machinery as well.  If you are insane and need more than that (why are you reading this review then????) then look at the I-Pods which sport hard drives as large as 80GB.",5,False,"12 21, 2004"

VariableQ,"I really wanted to like these headphones.  They are great for riding bike because you can still hear the environment while you ride.  When these work, they are great.  But I have gone through FOUR pairs of these!  Each one has had the same issue.  After using them just a couple of times (either running or riding bike) the headphones would start to make a buzzing noise, then no longer connect in the middle of the workout.  Pretty much as soon as I start getting sweaty, the headphones short out.  This is not what you want to happen when you are a few miles away from home.
After they dry out, sometimes they will work again until I use them again for cardio and they get sweaty.  Then the same thing happens.  The other complaint I have about them, is the Bluetooth range on them seems very limited.  I can't even put my phone in my pocket without getting interference.

I will say the customer service for aftershokz has been great, they've replaced them 3 times (I'm on my 4th pair).  But since this pair is doing the same thing again, I'm giving up on them.  So buyer beware, if sweat heavily from your head during cardio, I advise you to look at another set of headphones.",2,False,"07 3, 2015"

thedude42,"I built a total poor man's NAS with ZFS on Linux and wanted something that worked with my Sans Digital 4 bay JBOD's.  My original configuration had a single SiI 3132 controller with 2 eSATA ports connected to 2 of the fore mentioned JBOD's.  My goal for the Syba card was to add a second controller to split the io load between them.

The issue I had with this controller card was that it had to reset the links quite a bit before it figured out how it needed to talk to the disks, and when it did it seemed to add a significant amount of system time to the CPU utilization on the system.  I replaced this controller with an equally budget grde SiI 3132 based chip and the CPU utilization was instantly cut in half.

a customer,"First after opening of the package, I noticed that USB port is inserted crooked so you cannot put your USB cord in. After prying it with a screwdriver I was able to straighten it so I could insert the cord. Then I used the software included in the device to browse some radio stations and see what was there. Found one I liked, and commanded the unit to record. It does not say it on the package, but if you need to get three hours of records, you need to have it on downloading the music for those three hours. So, my first minute of recording gave me one minute of listening time. I didn't find how I can download a whole program to the device without it being connected to the station the whole time the program runs. You can listen to what you had recorded from your computer, too. I added some mp3 files from my collection, too.
Then I went to my car, and tried to listen. I only used the cord to connect it to the car stereo. It worked fine. I liked that it wouldn't run out of power in the middle of the road. Unfortunately, at least in my car (Chevy Malibu), the socket is located behind the shift stick, so it is a pain to insert the player in when the car is in parking, and the sticks obstructs your view of the screen, and if you choose to use the remote control you need to get your hand way to the right so the remote would work. But the playing itself was good, as good as it could be in the car.
I didn't want to bother with downloading pieces of radio programs, so I erased all the records that were on the player, and put my  mp3 files on it. There is less controls for listening then on regular mp3 players, particularly, I couldn't loop my albums or create a playlist.
After using the player for a few weeks the cable that connects the device to the car broke, and now I can see exposed wires. The whole thing looks very cheaply made, so I wasn't surprised.",3,False,"04 22, 2011"

vsop,"I purchased this headphone direct from Puro Sound Labs (gold/tan).  I almost went with white color but was worried about the white color getting dirty. I know as I have owned many headphones and the ear pads will get dirty, there is just no way around it.

My 7y old daughter lost her headphone on our trip back from California.  She loves listening to music (probably got that from me).  I love music and have very good headphones for myself and just couldn't get myself to purchase her another el-cheapo set and when I say el-cheapo I am more referring to bad sounding headphones.  Her previous set was a JBL for kids and although she likes the, she didn't love them and only used it when necessary.

What does my daughter think after 30 mins of use?  She absolutely loves it, she didn't want to take them off  to charge.  She loves the fit and look and the fact that there is no wires to get in the way.

What do I think?  I love it probably more than she does :)  They are really comfortable for an on ear unit, obviously will not compare to my Philips X2 or other over the ear type headphones.  Although really designed for kids, I honestly wouldn't mind wearing these myself...they are that nice.
What about the sound?  In short, they are fantastic.  I really hate that fact that headphones made for kids have terrible sound...the sound from these are probably more accurate than Beats headphones...I don't own beats but have listened to them and they are just bass bloated and ridiculously priced.  I have also read reviews of other sound limiting headphones (limit at 85db) for kids being not loud enough for noisy environment but I really can't see that being a problem.  I tested the feature a max volume and they are uncomfortably loud, I would never be able to listen at full volume and I can't imagine my daughter being able to bear that loud volume. I will report back if when we take this on our travels but I certain that it will not be a problem.

How as the bluetooth connection?  I took out the unit from the box, turned it on, lights started blinking, went to the bluetooth setting on my daughter's iPad, found the Puro BT2200, selected that device, a few seconds and it connected, pressed played on her music app and instant sound.  Can't get easier than that.

How is the quality?  It looks well constructed, only time will tell but at this point, I really don't have any concerns.  If you have seen the a gold iPhone, the construction of the aluminum looks and feels exactly like that, a very cool apple-joni-ive design look alike.

Daniel A. Dougan,"I bought this to support my LG W2253TQ-PF monitor since it does not have VESA holes on the back (lame).

The problem is that LG added a separate clear plastic piece under this monitor for turning it on and off and adjusting the settings. Mounting that monitor on this thing knocked the plastic piece off, and now it's much harder to turn the monitor on and off or adjust the settings.

LG really needs to design a better adapter for their non-VESA monitors...and, in general, all monitor manufacturers should stop making monitors without VESA holes for mounting.

For this product, the assembly was odd, and the instructions were somewhat unclear. It seems simple enough in theory, but the tricky part is that you don't tighten the screws all the way when attaching this to your VESA arm.",3,True,"07 14, 2016"
Michael J. Cashen,"This TV has excellent, vibrant color, much better than avg. especially when the picture mode is set to ""dynamic"" instead of standard.  There are enough contrast, backlighting, etc. controls to tweak it even better for those so inclined.
UPDATE 9/22/15: I'm slightly red-green colorblind (I fail those dot tests but see bright reds and greens ok) and I am thrilled at how vibrant the reds and greens are -as well as the rest of the colors. For example, I've been watching ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" for years including frequent reruns and only after getting this TV did I realize that Marie usually wears a pretty blouse that has a lot of red or pink or purple in it. END UPDATE
When you turn out the room lights, the blacks don't become grays as happens on many sub $1000 TV's.
It is a true 120 Hz TV that uses software to push it to 240 Hz, which helps give a tremendously short response time of 7.8 ms - the shortest time measured on any TV by rtings.com - resulting in very minimal motion blur, which not only makes movie video pop. but it is great for those playing state-of-the-art video games.
At least one review says the picture quality drops off when viewed at a 17 degree or greater angle, but I think it's close to optimum (dynamic setting) at least to 30 degrees.

The same review says that it plays, full screen, 1080i and 480i with a very excellent picture, but for some strange reason 720p (ABC, Fox, Ion, some shows on PBS, old movie/TV show channels, etc.) seems a little softer than normal but ""probably not noticeable by most.""  I think the 720p picture clarity looks as good as on other sub $1000 TV's and, of course, the color looks much better than avg.
UPDATE 9/22/15: After a couple weeks of regular season NFL games, I've been comparing the 720p video quality from ABC and Fox with the 1080i video quality from CBS - flipping channels back and forth - and I don't notice any ""softness"" from 720p which, by the way, has twice the refresh rate of 1080i so motion blur is slightly less - which is why big-on-sports ABC and Fox chose it over 1080i.

Another review complains about poor smart TV response to WiFi, but I had no problem setting up my Amazon Prime account directly with this TV (no computer, no Roku, etc. needed) and right now I'm streaming, with a slower-than-recommended 1 Mbps broadband service, the movie Star Trek: Into Darkness from Amazon Prime, and I'm getting a just slightly less than DVD-quality picture, in terms of resolution, with wonderful color stretched horizontally all the way across the screen.

You can browse the web from the TV, where the up, down, left, and right buttons on the remote move the cursor and a keyboard display appears when you need it.  But it's still MUCH easier to browse the web on a computer.  I browse Amazon Prime shows with my laptop and store those I want under my Watch List.  That makes them easier to find on this Samsung TV.

I do NOT have cable TV, and this TV picks up 52 broadcast stations with the top-rated, indoor Winegard FL5500A Flatwave Amped Antenna ($50.59 here at Amazon as I write this), a thin plastic sheet 13"" x 12"", pinned (1"" diagonally in from each upper edge) to the top of my 1st floor TV room's 8 ft. wall.  I live 7-10 miles from most Baltimore TV towers and 30-45 miles from most Washington, D.C. towers.
This TV picks up the schedules of all the channels - broadcast or cable or both - and shows a choice of a detailed Menu list on the entire screen of whats scheduled including details for each show or it shows a list of what's currently playing on the other channels on the right side of the screen while watching your current show.
The audio is not phenomenal, though there are several settings including ""movie,"" ""music,"" and ""clear voice.""

Personally, I planned to spent up to $599 for a TV but went an extra $50 when I got this much better TV for $649.99 with a 2-yr warranty thanks to a $150 off coupon at Costco (where it's sold as the model ...620D instead of ...6200, but is the same TV) that ran thru 8/2/15.  But I've done my homework and believe this to be the top under $800 TV because of the great picture quality and the decent quality other aspects.  This Samsung looks better to me than the similar-to-$800 offerings from LG, Vizio, and Sony in the same size.",5,False,"08 9, 2015"

Mr Lapin,"What I think some of the less satisfied reviewers here may be missing is a proper seal in the ear canal.  These phones are NOT earbuds.  The key is for them fit like earPLUGS.  The earmold should go in more deeply than you think.  If properly fitted they'll provide ample bass (but see below) and good noise reduction, and they won't slip or fall out.  However, Audio-Technica's instruction booklet tells you essentially nothing about how to fit them.

First, make sure you're using the correct unit for each ear.  The letters L and R are printed on the ear side of the phones, but they're almost impossible to read.  Hold one of the phones in front of you, the silicone earmold pointing to the left (as if you were about to put it in your right ear).  The earmold should be pointing upward at about a 45 degree angle.  The wire exiting from the phone should be running away from you.  No?  Grab the other phone.

With your left hand, pull up gently on the top of your right ear.  With your right hand, push the earmold *upward* into your ear canal with a slight twisting and rocking motion.  Repeat with the left ear, of course.

Much of the ambient noise should be gone, before you even switch on the dongle.  If you still hear lots of noise, or if the phones fall out just by the weight of the cord, you haven't inserted them right.  If necessary, try different earmold sizes.  In many cases you may need a SMALLER earmold, not a larger one, so the earmold goes deeply enough into the ear canal.  Also try adding a drop of K-Y Jelly or similar skin-safe lubricant to the silicone earmold.  You snicker!  I'm not joking.  It works.

The cord shouldn't hang down from your ears.  The wires should exit forward and slightly upward.  Loop the wires over the top of your ears and bring the wires together behind your head, not under your chin.  The sliding bit of plastic on the phone wires snugs up the wires, to keep them in place over your ears.  Bring the cord forward over one shoulder, and clip the dongle to your collar or pocket.  This will eliminate the thudding noise that dangling wires transmit to your ears when they hit something.

How do these phones work?  I'm not sure the ANC reduces noise by 20dB - I'd estimate it at something closer to 12dB - but it's still quite a substantial difference.  The pure isolation phones (without ANC) such as the Shures and Etymotics are great if you want to shut out the world entirely.  The ATH-ANC3s don't isolate quite as completely, so conversation is still possible (if a bit awkward).  Just hit the mute button.

Sound quality:  Warm and fat, with a sizable mid-bass peak.  The high end is a bit pinched and not too clean.  Instruments lack a sense of air around them.  Stereo imaging isn't what it could be.  There is some audible hiss when the ANC is on, but it's minimal, and far less objectionable than the background noise it's eliminating.

I'd characterize the ATH-ANC3's as a rock- or pop-oriented sound.  Classical music lovers might want to consider the Shure or Etymotic isolators - but remember, they cost 3-4 times as much.  For many folks, these phones will sound just fine and will almost certainly trounce the $1.50 cheapies that came with their mp3 players.

Build quality: I don't see too much to gripe about.  The dongle feels reasonably sturdy, though the clip looks flimsy.  These phones are made in China, unlike earlier (and more expensive) Audio Technica products that were made in Japan.  Be aware that they may not have passed through the kind of quality control that the name would suggest.  But also remember what you're paying for them.

Bottom line is that these phones provide significant relief from noise while still allowing conversation.  The sound is acceptable if not stellar.  I don't think I'd pay A-T's MSRP for them, but at anything under seventy bucks or so, they're a more than respectable value, especially if most of your listening is rock, jazz, or pop music.",4,True,"01 23, 2010"

RockShoX,"Faux leather, slim, fits the iPad Air like a glove. The cover feels a bit cheap compared to an authentic Apple made iPad cover but cost several times cheaper.

The edges are really well designed and flushed against the border of this iPad Air. Light weight overall.

Con: one reason why I took off a star... The smell of this cheap polyurethane cover is horrendous.  I am pretty sure the smell will dissipate in a few hours after I leave it out, but ugh...

Also, when I input an S-Video 4:3 signal, the 720p output image is stretched to 16x9, which distorts the picture and elongates it horizontally, and there's no way to keep the original 4:3 aspect ratio. Maybe some uneducated viewers don't like the black bars on the sides of their screen, but I can't watch a stretched-out picture, I think it looks horrible.

Lisa Shea,"I've been using this Seagate FreeAgent external hard drive for over a year now and I really have to say it's an excellent system. I've used it on both XP and Vista without any problems at all. It is very quiet compared with my other external hard drive. This Seagate hasn't had any sorts of issues at all and is always instantly acessible.

Compare that great performance with my new OneTouch drive. Even though the OneTouch is ""newer"" it randomly appears and disappears, sounds like a lawnmower sometimes and is just a pain to use.

Sometimes you don't appreciate how well something works until you get a new model which is really hard to deal with. The more I try other external drives, the more I really appreciate the Seagate FreeAgent and how smoothly it installs and operates.

A note for those who don't understand how computer memory works. When they say this drive is 320 gig they mean the actual disk storage space is 320,070,287,360 actual bytes. If you remember back in basic computer school, a ""K"" is 1024 bytes. It s NOT 1000 bytes!! So therefore the capacity measured in strict K is 298 GB. This is NOT because of OS loss - it is because of the way you count bytes and bits. I really wouldn't obsess about that 20 gig and the 2 large pictures you might have stored in that space. The 320 gig is quite ample for me to hold the video files I work with in a given month.

J. Peake,"This is my first review on Amazon, so I hope you'll cut me some slack... :-)  Anyway, I'm a casual gameplayer (I like World of Warcraft), so I wanted a mouse that would be reliable, responsive, comfortable, and affordable.  Basically everything anyone would want in a mouse, but even more so for gaming.

By the way, if you search Amazon for ""logitech g7"" you'll get multiple listings for this exact same item so, not knowing what else to do, I'm going to post this review on every listing.  Wouldn't you do the same?  I dunno...

So, first of all, I read lots of reviews to try and decide what would give me the best equipment for the money.  This is a pretty expensive mouse, but I made it more affordable by buying a refurbished item online.  That might have been a mistake, or it might not -- I'll never know.  Anyway, keep that in mind here.  Maybe ""factory new"" units will be less likely to display the problems I noted below.

So, here's the long and the short of it:

Pros:

- Nice heft and ergonomics.
- Laser seems to work well on all surfaces (except glass desktops -- forget it).
- Good software for customizing and adapting to particular games (i.e. you can customize the effect of clicking the thumb button, scrolling the wheel, tilting the wheel, etc.)
- Battery level is indicated via LED's on the mouse itself.  Also, when low charge is critical, the software will pop up a window to tell you so.  (However this window will not always intrude into the game you're playing, so beware.)
- Double lithium-ion batteries ensure that you're never up the creek without a mouse.  While you're using one battery, you're recharging the other.

Cons:

- Scroll wheel has an annoying ratcheting sound & feel when spun.
- Left/right tilt function of scroll wheel failed before very long.  Now when I push the wheel to the right, it just sticks there, instead of snapping back to center.

Neither here nor there:

The mouse provides a pair of buttons, ""+"" and ""-"", right behind the scroll wheel, for increasing or decreasing the sensitivity.  For me, once I've got the sensitivity I want (which I can do through the Windows Control Panel), I really don't ever need to change it, so those two buttons are a waste for me.  Although I guess I can reprogram them to do something more interesting.  Ah well; to each his/her own.

And a note about the batteries:

The double battery system works fine for me, and it will work fine for you, as long as you realize that recharging a battery via a USB port (which is your only option) is a very long process.  Basically, you'll want to keep the charger attached to your PC all the time, so that when your active battery runs out, you can swap 'em.  By the way, of the two batteries I received in my refurb, one seems to take a lot longer to fully charge.  In fact, by the time I've discharged the one battery through use, the weaker battery will only have just reached full charge in the charger.  Not a real problem, but I figured you should be aware.

Bottom line:  Good mouse if you're not a major gamer and can get a good discount price for it.",3,False,"10 24, 2007"

When I take a picture I use the automatic mode (I'm to busy taking pictures to worry about all the different kinds of modes and stuff), just point and click, real easy. The pictures come out great and even though you my be moving a little there is no blur. The video aspect is great also, the only limit is the ammount of memory you have in the camera. They say this is an entry level camera, but I disagree. It for sure is a mid level entry digital camera. Maybe one day I'll learn what all this camera can do and really be astonished.

Ian J. Hayes,"The Zune HD is a great portable music player which, as an added bonus, can play videos downloaded onto it. Amazingly, it also accesses the internet wirelessly. Portability, size, appearance, sound quality and functions are very satisfactory. There are a few limitations. The size of the screen makes web surfing nigh impossible as everything is exceedingly tiny. The ability to rotate the device from vertical to horizontal to expand a web screen helps, but serious browsing needs a much bigger screen. Typing on the tiny keyboard means many errors and retypes as one's fingers are just too big - a stylus does help.  Beware that the Zune software (Microsoft) does not support Adobe Flash, so playing many internet videos such as on Youtube, is not possible. Audio files do not support .wav format, so some converting of your music may be necessary. Audio files sound great, and videos look excellent on the clear and bright screen. The Zune is like a smartphone that doesn't make phone calls. Some are saying that stand alone audio devices such as the Zune and iPod are a fading technology, and they are likely right. Microsoft no longer makes Zunes, so if you want a separate player, get them while supplies last. This one is excellent.
Edit: After using the Zune player for about a year, I have given up on it. I have changed my star rating from 4 stars to one. The player itself is mechanically sound and gives decent audio fidelity for this kind of device. However, the software is a total abomination. The device will not interface with any software other than the Zune management software, and the interface between computer and device is untrustworthy. The software will not recognize all the music files on the computer. Playlist creation may or may not occur, and if it does, the Zune frequently loses entire playlists or songs that are part of a playlist. Editing playlists is impossible, as the addition of a single song may delete all the others. Hours of drag-and-dropping often lead to no successful result. I cannot in words express the degree of frustration and exasperation I have endured. I regret the original 4 star rating solely based upon the abysmal interface software. I have since taken hammer to the device and feel - good.",1,True,"09 22, 2011"

On those days I am very impressed with the drives.

A concern for me is that the drives always take a while to spin up when they are called upon - for example, when I am prompted to upload a file, my system basically freezes until the drives spin up into action - and there are times when they make all the right noises but don't fully complete the process.

Dig The Dome,"I have a 2003 Pontiac Vibe that I intend to keep for a while and finally decided to replace the factory stereo. I have the Moon and Tunes package which included a power amp and I thought the stereo sounded fine. My reason for updating was that I wanted bluetooth and USB input for music/audio books/podcasts.

Once the Pioneer was installed was I in for a very pleasant surprise! It is a completely different stereo now. Much fuller sound and a vastly better equalizer. There are five separate frequency settings that you can adjust as well as a loudness control like in my home stereo for bass boost at low volumes. The volume control goes all the way up to 60, but 6-7 is a very comfortable setting and I can't turn it past 10 as it gets way too loud.

The color settings for the display although seemingly gimmicky works well to match the radio to the colors on the dash. Since the Vibe drives with lights on all the time, dimming the display at night was an issue until I found the timer settings for telling the head unit when to dim and brighten the display. Great feature. I may periodically have to adjust the start and stop times but well worth it.

The unit came with a remote control which I am used to using from another brand of radio but this one was very easy to learn the functions of the buttons quickly. The remote sits in one of my drink holders and I can reach and operate it without taking my eyes off the road.

The only negative I can find is that placing a phone call via the bluetooth requires interaction with the front panel of the head unit. The remote can only hang up a call so this requires looking at the front panel to place a call and is somewhat of a safety issue. I set up auto answer so incoming calls are automatically answered on the third ring.

For me it was a toss up between this unit and a JVC KW-R910BT which matches almost feature for feature. I have used JVC in the past and was planning to go for the JVC due to past good experience with JVC, but a friend strongly recommended this one instead and I am happy I tried the Pioneer. On other big plus for the Pioneer over the JVC is that the phone button on the display panel is on the left side closer to the driver which is better in my opinion than on the right on the JVC. The only option I would have liked to have is HD Radio but it isn't worth an extra $100 for it. The JVC I have in my truck has it and I do like the clarity of the FM HD radio signal vs regular FM.

And finally like the title of my review states, I like it so much I will buy another one of these for my wife's car here shortly. One ding for Amazon's information about my car and this radio is that you need an antenna adapter to go from the tiny antenna line from the car into the standard antenna jack in the back of the radio. This was not mentioned anywhere and is apparently common on many newer vehicles, especially GM vehicles. I had to order it after installation so it will mean pulling the radio out of the dash one more time to put the adapter in. Not happy about that, but that is not Pioneer's fault.",5,True,"01 21, 2015"

S. Brewer,"First off, I want to say that I had reservations about buying this mouse because of the issues that appear in many of the negative reviews. Most oft mentioned appears to be the stiffness of the buttons and problems using the scroll strip. I am happy I did not let the negative reviews deter me.

I think the reason that these issues are consistently mentioned in the negative reviews has to do with a person's preference on how to hold a mouse. If the mouse is held as it is intended to be held, with the arc supporting the palm of your hand, you will not have any issues with the stiffness of the buttons.

However, if you prefer to prop your hand up on top of the mouse with only your fingertips resting on the mouse, then they are likely to rest too far rearward on the buttons, which are essentially levers. With your fingers near the pivot point of the lever, it will require more force to move the lever than it would if you placed your fingers at the end of the lever, as intended.

I have quite small hands and I have no problem operating the buttons. If you are able to adapt to how the mouse is meant to be held, you will have no problem with the buttons as well. However if you are a stubborn person and refuse to make the minor adjustment, you will likely be leaving a negative review.

As for the scroll strip, I had no problems with it... after I tweaked the settings a bit. Using the Intellipoint software (not included, must download from MS), I decreased the sensitivity of the scroll strip all the way down to 4, and turned the vibration feedback down to 3. With these settings I was able to tune the feel of the scroll strip to closely match my usual desktop mouse, a Razer Lachesis. And perhaps again because I was holding the mouse properly, I had no problems with any erratic behavior from the scroll strip.

Other than that, I don't have much to add to the rest of the positive reviews. The mouse feels great in the hand, tracks on any surface, and the ability to fold it flat is brilliant, and a definite plus for fitting it in my small netbook case. While the original Arc mouse may have been the inspiration for the Arc Touch's design, the Arc and the Arc Touch do not compete with each other. The original Arc, when folded, was no smaller than most any other mouse. However with the Arc Touch, you get a full sized mouse that can be stored in the smallest of cases. The upcoming MS Touch Mouse also does not compete with the Arc Touch, as it simply a full-sized mouse with a touch-capable surface.

For these reasons, I consider the Arc Touch to be the absolute best travel mouse you can buy. The only thing that keeps this mouse from being 5-star perfect is the fact that it requires a USB dongle. If the mouse used Bluetooth instead, it would be able to communicate with laptops that have Bluetooth radios built in, eliminating the need for a dongle. If MS makes an Arc Touch Bluetooth, I will not hesitate to buy one.",4,True,"06 27, 2011"

W. Uncapher,"This Sony Bluetooth speaker is simply amazing! Sony has yet another winner! It's an engineering masterpiece! The build  quality is outstanding. Both sides of the speaker are brushed stainless steel. The front grill is metal. And the swing out stand in the back is also metal. The speaker is on the heavy side, considering it's size. But, to me that means it's very well built. Not all cheap plastics like many other brands. This Bluetooth speaker sounds amazing! I listened to the Bose Soundlink II and the Jawbone Big Jambox side-by-side along with this Sony SRS-BTX500. I disregarded the piped in music of the store display. And instead, linked the Bluetooth on each to my smartphone. Therefore being able to play and hear my own music. And not what the store provides on their display. The Sony was the most balanced of the three. And also the clearest. Vocals really shine on the Sony. Just listen to Christina Aguilera's voice in Pitbull's ""Feel This Moment"". Her voice was very crisp and clear, I was sold! The bass on the Sony is very good. And not overpowering and muddy or distorted as with the Big Jambox. The Bose Soundlink II, produces great highs and mids. But, just isn't quite as clear as the Sony. And the Bose really lacks when it comes to bass. Virtually not existent on the Bose. I also like the speakerphone feature, works very well. Jawbone may have a slight edge here. But, not enough to make up for the superior sound of the Sony. The battery life of the Sony SRS-BTX500 is very good. I do get the ample 6 hours of life out of each charge. And a little longer life, if I play the speaker at volumes of 50% or less. This speaker is unbeatable. You must hear it, touch it and hold it! And you will be sold. Also, as for the reviewer's opinion here on the Klipsch KMC 3. The Klipsch is not rechargeable. And it takes 8! Yes, 8 D cell batteries. And it cost $100 dollars more! I don't know about you! But, I don't own a battery factory. And the Klipsch should sound better for $100 more. But, I'll take my Sony any day with it's lithium-ion rechargeable battery. Plus, Sony also provides instructions for removing the battery when it no longer holds a charge, and to recycle it as well. So you can replace it will a new one!",5,False,"10 5, 2013"

In the end I ended up buying both. I can honestly say I love both for different reasons. I would say the sound quality of the MDR7506 is amazing. While the same is true for the Sennheiser  headphones in the treble range, in the bass range a lot of instrument timbre is somewhat lost. Which is not to say that the level of bass output is low, because the bass can get pretty loud, but the ability to tell what instrument is producing a very bass note is kind of lost. The reason I love the Sennheiser headphones is that they are extremely comfortable! After using the sony headphones for more than a few hours my ears start to get kind of sore, however the Sennheiser headphones remain comfortable after 4+ hours of straight listening. As far as durability go, the sennheiser headphones seem like they can take more abuse than the MDR7506 based on the fact that the MDR7506s have more moving parts and exposed wiring. Because of this fact, I actually ended up later buying a second pair of MDR7506's in case the first break.",5,True,"03 30, 2010"

Rusty,"I purchased this keyboard for my media PC that I built for my living room. That being said, it has served it's purpose VERY well. This keyboard is a good wireless keyboard overall. There are a few minor drawbacks that I've noticed after using it for a while now. I'll list what I like about it first:

-The keys feel good to type on. They're not mushy, but not loud/clanky either. They are more on the soft side.
-Battery life is pretty good. The keyboard seems to sleep/reserve power pretty quickly when not being used.
-The touchpad is nicely sized. It has some handy multitouch and scrolling features to it as well as integrated left/right click buttons at the bottom of it.
-I like the very small button at the top left of the keyboard that functions as a left click. It's in a very convenient place that feels natural for using it in conjunction with the mousepad.
-The volume control and mute button on the left side is nice as well.
-The media buttons that are just above the touchpad on the right side of the keyboard are nice as well. With the software that is available to download, you can map them to open specific programs.
-It's pretty sleek looking, and it doesn't weigh a lot.

Dislikes:
-There is not a control key on the right hand side of the keyboard. Personally, this is extremely annoying to me because I use that particular key a LOT for text navigation/manipulation.
-Also, there's not any dedicated home/end buttons either. This isn't as big of a deal as the lack of a right-hand side control key, but I still miss the keys for using them a lot on normal/full keyboards.
-For some strange reason, the media keys are set as the default keys for F1-F12. This is hassle-some because in order to use the regular F keys, you have to hold down the function key. Normally, it's the other way around and you have to hold the function key for media functions. For people who don't use the F keys a lot, this probably wouldn't be a huge deal, but I find it annoying sometimes personally...
-One other thing I've noticed is that the keyboard doesn't always register correctly if it's not completely flat/level. I've found that this can usually be remedied by replacing the batteries with new ones.
-Finally, the last thing that I've noticed is that there is no indicator light for the caps lock key. I really wish there was some kind of l.e.d. light or something, but as it is, there's no way to tell on the keyboard itself.",4,True,"09 13, 2014"

So I read the Amazon reviews and got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AKG-K391-NC-High-Performance-Noise-Cancelling-In-Ear-Headphones-with-Mic-Black-Silver/dp/B009KNO1IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AKG K391 NC High-Performance Noise Cancelling In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Silver)</a>. How could I go wrong? It's got generally great reviews and AKG is a well-respected high-end brand. But frustration set in as soon as I found a box dangling from my ears with nothing to hold it up. I tried to improvise a solution, but ultimately, the whole setup wound up annoying no matter what I did.

While I had initially scoffed at the idea of shelling out $300 for the Bose, I did and I'm glad I did. The whole experience has filled me with elation. Here are highlights:

 Elegant and ""frustration free"" packaging. Whereas I had to tear the AKG box apart to get the headphones out, I had the Bose hooked up to my USB charging in just about a couple minutes. No tearing, no frustration. As with Apple products, unpacking the Bose was tailored for a positive customer experience.
 Fast charging. It only took about three hours before I was up and running.
 Logical, well-engineered chord system. The box containing the noise-cancellation (NC) circuitry is located next to the jack that plugs into your iPod or other playback unit PLUS it is lightweight and covered with on-slip rubberize surface. Therefore, unlike the AKGs its weight is supported by whatever sound generation device it is attached to, not by the buds sticking out of your ears. To further elaborate, I typically will use headphones with my iPod. My iPod has clip that attaches to my belt. So the the Bose box will simple hang from there. It works.
 Tangle free chords. The chords are thick and have just about the right level of stiffness so they are hard to get tangled up.
 Great sound with the NC off.
 Great sound PLUS unparalleled isolation from the outside world with NC on. I currently own two NC headphones. The Bose is vastly superior to both and seems to block far more noise than any NC headphones I've ever owned or tried. When you flip the NC switch on, the degree of sound removal is so dramatic that -- it seems like magic.

My one gripe:

 The case that it comes with is too small. Yes, you can force it in, but I'm crazy about the sharp bends I'll have to inflict on the cords in order to this. Irony is that, I also own the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bose-IE2-Audio-Headphones/dp/B003XU6H8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bose IE2 Audio Headphones</a>&nbsp;and even though there's less gadgetry in it, it comes with a bigger case. This does not overshadow the greatness of these headphones, but I mention this to anyone else who runs into this minor frustration. You are not along. Just find a bigger case for your Bose.

When I contemplated getting these, I wondered how in the world can Bose justify a price that is almost twice as much as what I paid for the AKGs?

2. The stretchy ""bellows"" that prevent the clamshell from fully opening can sometimes bow out and have to be pushed back in with your finger before zipping up.

3. The zipper can sometimes stick a little when going around the corners...not too bad though.

Other than those minor issues, this case does what it's supposed to...and for the asking price you really can't expect more than that.",4,True,"02 27, 2011"

For example, if someone is working on your network equipment, upgrading firmware, etc., that process is likely to take more than a minute.  It would be disastrous for the ezOutlet to power cycle the network equipment in the middle of a firmware upgrade.

Being able to specify a 5 or 10 minute ping outage as being OK, when desired, before power cycling the load would be reasonable.  If this feature is added, I will raise this review to 5 stars.",3,True,"03 6, 2017"

Dr. Holly,"There are only a few things that you can ask of a charger for any electronic device in my honest opinion.  1) Does it work? 2) Is the charging cord long enough, as to allow for simultaneous charging and device use at the same time?  3) Does it overheat or have performance issues?

This charger for me is used with the first edition LG GPad.  I got this charger after my old cord split on the inside port and finally quit working.  After using this charger for the last couple of months, there are zero complaints to report.  It charges quickly, seems durable and not cheaply made.  The cord is not exactly long but it is long enough for when I've needed to put the tablet on emergency charge and still use.  As of my purchase date, the price is reasonable so even if this charger doesn't last as long as one would hope, it still would be a good buy.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing a solid OEM replacement.  As a side note and albeit unimportant - I love the blue light glowing on the main plug.

Andrew R.,"Just like most people, I found the same issues with the device.

Default volume is very high.
  - But there is a fix for that, Under settings see default volume, change it. I change mine to 5. that issue resolved.

No wiring guide whatsoever.
  - Wires are pretty common though, the remaining wires:
  - Back (+12v in from reverse light). When you put the car in reverse the unit automatically switches to rear camera if you have one
  - Key 1 and SW GND wires. Used for steering wheel controls. Key 1 is the main steering wheel control and the other is the ground.

The unit did however come with updated maps (2012 Q3). And there is no loud screaming sound when directions are spoken.
I did check with Tappah Dinall (see his review) and after I ""donated"" $20 he sent me his maps but they are from 2011. I am guessing that Pyle figured out the issues so they included latest maps with the unit this time. I am not sure what other older units were coming with.

So far I am very happy with the unit. The install was a breeze after I went to best-buy and got a wiring harness to make life easier ($20). then i just wired the harness to the radio harness and plugged into vehicle. only the steering wheel keys I had to connect after that.

I did not attach the iPod cable as I do not own (or ever will own) any apple products so I cannot comment on that functionality.

Bluetooth paired easily with my nexus 4. works great. have not tried the hands free calling yet but streaming audio is awesome.

Did plug in a additional SD card with music and some movies I had. Plays MP4 files flawlessly.

The unit did crash once when navigation was running, a MP4 file was playing and I went in to settings menu to setup the steering wheel keys. The unit got sluggish and wouldn't respond to any commands then reset itself. I guess that was a little too much multitasking for it. Under normal circumstances it should not have to deal with all of those. I find the unit behaving very snappy when navigation is off. For the price it's not bad.

UPDATE:
I did find a bug with the unit if you will. I have a SD card in the unit with a bunch of MP3s. The unit plays them properly but doesn't appear to read the ID3 tags properly. I will look into that. However the bug is, say it's playing the songs in order, it gets to song 2, or 3, or 4 depending on how long you let it play. If you turn off the ignition and leave the car (unit turns off), when coming back, it does not resume playing, it starts back from song 1. It is kind of annoying if you have 200 songs in a folder. You never get to hear the end unless you go on a really long drive. :).

I will add more info as I go along.

UPDATE 2:
More annoying bugs with the unit... Previous one with the MP3 playing not resuming where it left off is still extremely annoying.
Another bug: If you have a rear view camera attached to the unit, when the car is in reverse, it switches automatically to the video feed, great, problem is the volume controls do not work in that mode. neither do the volume controls on the steering wheel. Just annoying if you want to lower the volume as you are backing up the car or anything like that.

There is an option in the settings to completely mute the sound when in reverse so I may use that instead.",5,True,"06 28, 2013"

Morris L.,"I have had a SSD drive from Intel in my work laptop for over a year, so I knew Intel's quality was good. That's why I chose this drive over another brand. I bought this one for my son's laptop, and his battery life went from 2.5-3 hours on a brand new Windows 7 laptop to over 6 hours. Both are with the same power management settings. The one thing I tweaked after the comparison was the hard drive power settings. There is no need for Windows to turn off the disk or put it in power saving mode, so you can turn those options off.

Adding this drive also improved Skyrim's frame rate from about 20 to about 40. It is now very playable on medium graphics settings with the ""High Performance"" power management plan. It wasn't before we installed this disk.

Boot time from a full shut down is about 30 seconds. From sleep mode, it's about 10 seconds. Installing Windows took about 15 minutes from an empty drive to first login, but I did the install using files stored on a USB drive.

Bottom line: this drive is fast. Once you have gotten used to having everything run so much faster than with a traditional disk, you'll never use anything else. Right now, I think I'll be sticking with Intel because I've never had any problems with my work laptop's SSD in over a year.",5,True,"02 8, 2012"

Kort,"The Sabrent 3-Port USB 3.0 Hub is a welcome add-on for iMac users such as myself. I have a 27"" iMac 5K, and this makes plugging in USB cables, charging devices, and accessing memory cards so much easier. I almost wish Apple had built such ports in, but then we wouldn't have such aftermarket products that compliment the clean design of the original Apple product. It works really well too. It snaps easily into a single USB port on the back of my computer and is ready to go.

I've had no issues running 3 USB cables simultaneously through this hub. Camera memory cards fit easily in the appropriate ports and access data quickly as well. It will charge my mouse and iPhone, but won't charge an iPad. The connection in back is pretty secure, but you may want to hold the body of the hub when plugging items in. Also, the ""eject"" buttons on top of the unit are pretty much inaccessible when it is plugged in for normal use, but for the USB ports at least, they're not required. You're paying a bit extra to have the ports snug up against the body of the iMac but you may find it worth to keep desktop clutter to a minimum (as I do).

If you would rather not reach around to the back of your iMac to access ports, and could use 3 extra, plus memory card inputs, then the
Sabrent 3-Port USB 3.0 Hub is an excellent solution. I've had no issues with it conflicting with other USB peripherals already in operation.

Jerry Palmerino,"This device feels solid, but is lightweight and small. It have it sitting next to my TV.

It looks like a home theatre device, but, like alot of products in this category, it is not as wide as a DVD player or VCR.  It has a full complement of connectivity, including optical sound out, HDMI, USB, ethernet, composite A/V out, and component video out...BUT...no wireless.  If you want wireless, you can buy a wireless ethernet bridge or switch, and connect it via the ethernet port.

It allows for a range of online services including Netflix, YouTube, Pandora, MediaFly, Live365, Blockbuster On Demand, AccuWeather, Facebook and Flickr. It currently does not support Amazon On Demand and Vudu, which was disappointing to me since I am an Amazon Prime subscriber.

I like the media library feature, which scans all of your media and puts it into one database.  I was alble to sync the media on my Twonky Iomega Drive over the network and store it locally on this 1TB hard drive.

The ""Mochi"" user interface is quite stunning, especially with the default desktop pictures.  I like the tabular sidescrolling menus at the bottom of the screen.  After a downloadable software update, the user interface got even better.  The sub-menus are much more organzied after the update.  Rather than a scrolling vertical list, the options are presented in a nice column arrangement.  Yuo get to the sub-menus by clicking on the aforementioned tabs at the bottom of the screen.

Overall, this device is a nice piece for your home theatre.  It can play almost any file format you throw at it and its 1TB hard drive is a nice size for storing content.  The Western Digital WD TV Live Hub makes a great set top box for your media viewing pleasure.",5,False,"03 16, 2011"

Sofia Hernandez,"When this item was available for review I made the erroneous 'assumption' (you know what they say about assumptions?!) that even though it was limited to Ipod and IPhone devices, there would be some sort of connectivity to an Apple laptop and Window based device.  I was dead wrong!  You cannot connect this device to your Windows computer unless you plan to pull out the 4gb included card.  That is where the issue lies... without the Apple device there is no Bemo Social Cam app; hence there isn't any type of editing, customizing,  sharing or even view finder available.  The product is crippled from the start.

As far as the aesthetics... it is small and light housed in a plastic body.  It actually feels like the older generation flash drives or Sony sticks.  The highest resolution is only 720p; for the purchase amount it should have been 1080p.  It films well enough but not as well as most of today's higher end cellphones.  Our biggest pet peeve is the fact that there isn't a viewfinder on the device followed closely by the issue of having to hold down the one and only button to record.  It was tiring being in that position but I felt as if I would have been rewarded when I played the video.  Replaying the video was a let down because it was shaky, grainy and constantly out of zoom (by the way, there is NO ZOOM).  Everything was out of frame half the time because of the lacking viewfinder on the device.  The biggest offense was that the device does not continue shooting after a minute.  It makes another file.  That's crazy!!

As I already mentioned previously, I do not own any of the compatible devices so I had to figure out a work around.  We were able to connect it to our daughter's Mac Book Air and view the video clips.  There was not an edit option and we were not able to download the app on that Apple device which is rather silly.  All that we could do was view.  We found that the blue tooth kept on going in and out via this method.

I usually love all Logitech products and thought that goes into each device; just not this time!  Without your cell phone or Apple Ipod, the Bemo Social Cam is severely crippled and limited.  Why do they insist on designing these proprietary products?  I really wanted this cam for my girls... they love their Apple Mac book and I really believed this would work seamlessly.  Shame on me.

I do realize that I was not able to review the editing aspects but I will still stand by my rating.  The cam is a silly afterthought that doesn't do what it should.  720p video could be had for less money and without a tangible viewfinder and zoom capabilities that can shoot video for over 1 min intervals and dedicated charging cord; you should skip it!

Craig,"I used this to touch up some scratches on an old Yamaha synthesizer that had a black anodized finish on the aluminum cover plate.  You cannot tell where the touch-up paint and the anodized finish meet.  In other words, they blended perfectly.  I had just about given up on finding a good color match for the old synthesizer, but after using this product, I feel like it was the best ten bucks I've spent all month.  I let the paint dry for about 24 hours and then went over it with an alcohol-dipped towel to see if it would stay on, and it did.  This stuff is permanent on aluminum and you won't have to worry about it coming off, like an acrylic model paint will.  As far as application goes, it takes a while for the paint to make its way to the tip the first time you use it.  Other than that, I have zero complaints about this product.",5,True,"09 5, 2014"

Jacob,"Recently I built a new house with HDMI cabling built in and I was able to have my tv mounted and all my DVr and Bluray player in a different place so I wasn't crowding the area where the tv was hanging.  The down side was I only had one HDMI outlet.  Not thinking ahead I was stumped on what to do.  I had almost shelled out 300 dollars for a massive device that in truth I waasn't going to use half of it.  That was when I found this little gem.  With three ports for three devices I was able to hook up everything and run it to the single outlet that was hooked up to the tv in another section of the room.
  Now the only real down side I can say is the length of cord at the end its not very long and if you want to have to bend down to change the port then that's the only real hang up I can find with this.  And since I have only two ports used I am trying to figure out what I can use the thrid for.  Also I got this a day eariler then I was scheduled for.  So that was a plus.

D.T.,"Before buying this great innovation, please do consider the following:
1. The mouse was designed to be used without a surface.  Yes, it can also be used on a surface with its optical sensor.  But the designers of this product shaped the mouse to be held comfortably in the air instead of on a desk.  The slim design of the mouse with large buttons makes it a bit unnatural when used on a surface.  However, it fits perfectly in the hand when held in the air.  So, before buying the gyration, please do keep in mind that the designers meant for this product to be used WITHOUT a surface most of the time.
2. After doing a ton of research online, I have found that this is the only wireless input device (besides remotes) that has a range over 10 ft.  In my apartment, I was able to use both devices, keyboard and mouse, as far away as 22-23 feet from the base.  Originally I was losing connection at about 19 feet.  After placing the base at a higher location, I was able to achieve almost 23 feet range.
Many people complain that the mouse is uncomfortable on a desk.  Well, as I stated above, it is not designed to be used on a desk by the computer or else why would the long range be necessary.
If you do a quick search or look on Logitech's web site, you will find that most wireless/cordless input devices' range is only 6 feet.  Why?  because they are designed for the main purpose of reducing clutter.
The gyration product is designed to be used far away from the desktop computer.  Since you will be more than 8-15 feet away from your desktop computer, you will not be able to really see your monitor.
Keep in mind that this product is to be used in conjunction with a computer hooked up to a big screen TV or a projector.
3. The compact keyboard is okay.  The keyboard is the reason I am not giving this product 5 stars.  The keyboard layout can be improved.  It is supposed to be like a laptop keyboard.  For some strange reason, gyration did not mimic laptop keyboard layouts.
Just compare the layout of the gryation keyboard layout to any laptop keyboard, you will immediately notice the differences.
The most annoying one is the ""function"" key being at the bottom left corner instead of the ""ctrl"" key.  The two should be flipped.
I type between 65-80 words per minute on normal keyboards.  The gyration keyboard does slow me down a bit, but I do find too hard get used to.
Definitely think about getting the full sized keyboard instead.
So...
IF you are looking for a wireless input device to REDUCE CLUTTER, do NOT buy this product.
IF you are going to be using a wireless input device on a desk near your desktop computer or laptop more than 85% of the time, do NOT buy this product.
Do buy this product if you are planning to hook up your desktop computer to a big screen TV and sit back on a couch.
This is the best product to set up a computer in the living room without having to mess up your living room look.  The desktop computer can be hidden away without a monitor.
The mouse response is fast.  It does take some practice to get a hang of it.  But remember this is the ONLY full functioning pointing device that can be used in mid-air with long range.
The mouse and keyboard uses the same base station.  Zero conflicts when using both devices at the same time in terms of interferences or slow down.
Let me stress again to all of you looking for wireless input devices.  If you are going to be using your wireless input devices on a desk near your computer, DO NOT buy the gyration. You will hate it.  You should consider products from Logitech which makes great input devices in my opinion.
If you are going to be using the wireless input device without a surface and far away from your computer, this is the perfect and only solution for you.",4,False,"07 17, 2003"
Jacob Jose,"My initial impression is that this screen protector is a good value for the money. I may even rate it excellent, but I don't know since it is my first purchase of a screen protector.

Pros:
1. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that all micro-bubbles had vanished after 12 hours of application. When I had looked at reviews of similar products, this seemed to stand out as the most prominent drawback of competing screen protectors.
2. Hasn't fully evaluated the kindle sensitivity after application (should play angry birds), but touch sensing for browsing meets my expectations
3. Three times cheaper than available competing products (even after including shipping) when I bought this.

Cons:
1. I believe the product I got is slightly (very slightly) big for kindle fire, so it leaves some of the extra sticker at two of edges even after the protector is tightly aligned at the remaining two edges. I am afraid the screen protector would come off after a while and I need to invoke the lifetime guarantee and run behind a replacement procedure. This makes it hard for me to believe that the product was designated for a kindle and not some 7"" touch screen. Not happy.
2. The manual showed a screen protector being applied to a cellphone (not a kindle).. I am not pleased since some other vendors even have detailed videos of applying their (more expensive) screen protectors to kindle.",4,True,"12 16, 2011"

I typically carry a larger professional tripod, however it would be nice to have the option to throw on a small quick tripod on the side.

Amazon Customer,"These Cloop cable keepers are easily one of the best and practical ideas I have seen for cable management. I have used velcro straps, cable wraps, etc and none works as great as these cable keepers. These combine an elastic silicone strap and neodymium magnets into a small, easy-to-use cable organizer. These have a slit in the middle through which you feed your cable such that it always stays attached. With many other cable organizers, I'll likely need to detach them when I want to use the cables, and hope that I won't misplace them. On the other hand, these cable keepers always stay on the cables but you can detach and reuse them if needed.

These small cable keepers are best suited to organizing earphones and small charging cables. They work great on my stock iPhone earphones and charging cable. The neodymium magnets are strong enough to keep them wrapped up neatly. I have tried them on a 6-ft. charging cable but it's too thick to keep the magnetic ends to stay closed.

In addition to organizing cables by wrapping them up, these cable keepers are also great for organizing cables by hanging them on a file cabinet or from a desk. Since the cable keepers always stay on the cables, I simply flatten the cable keepers and use their magnetic ends to attach the cables to the metal file cabinet or a metal plate on the desk. They work on the fridge door too.

I have also used these cable keepers as a shirt clip and they work perfectly. They are very handy both to keep my earphones organized when not in use, and to clip the cable to my shirt in order to minimize microphonics when I'm using the earphones.

Overall, these cable keepers are a practical cable management system that is easy to use and works great. Currently, these are available in a package of 3 in different colors - red, black and white. I wish there were more color choices, which would be useful for cable identification purposes. At any rate, I really like this cable management system. Practical and easy to use.

Patrick O,"I have a mixed relationship with Dell laptops. I have been using or helping those who are using Dell laptops since about 2004.  They had a great build quality then, great service and prices.  But, it seems that Dell goes up and down in quality as the years past. You never know if you're buying during a lemon year (2008) or a great year (2006). I note those years because those are specific laptops. My wife had one from late 2008 and it was constantly causing problems. Constantly crashing, restarting, freezing.  It was always a bother, even with lots of attention.  Finally died entirely early last year.

On the other side, I got a laptop in very early 2007. Still use it.  I've replaced some parts here and there, like the touchpad and keyboard and LED screen. But, it keeps on ticking.  Works great.  We got a Dell Desktop in 2010 and it works great.

So I want to like Dell, but I've known others who have mixed stories like we do, and so I'm cautious.

Dell has a winner with the Inspiron 15R here.  I recommend it absolutely.  It's not a sleek, light laptop, but you have to pay a fair amount more for that. It's really the laptop that has been around for about 10 years, updated with contemporary technology. And updated well.

First of all, it has Windows 8.  Windows 8 can be a real bother for all kinds of reasons, but I find this computer works as well with it as possible. No glitches or crashes or any problems. My wife has an HP model of similar build and price, and it seems to have consistent problems with drivers or other concerns which cause a freeze.  After 6 weeks of constant use of this (I'm a professor and writer), not a single problem.  The trick to getting Windows 8 to work right is a very cheap program called Start8.  Look it up online, made by stardock. It basically restores Windows 7 convenience while still making use of Windows 8 functionality.

As to this computer. The touchscreen works wonderful, though, I find I have to remind myself to use it. I'm used to the old fashioned way. Add to this the problem that Microsoft insists on Windows 8 having a touchscreen look, while not really making a touchscreen all that necessary.  For instance, the Office programs have very little touchscreen functionality that I've found. It's good for apps and such but basically a distraction.

Features include USB 3.0, which is the newer standard and makes USB transfers extremely fast. Which usually isn't a big concern except for backing up onto an external hard drive. And with only 500GB of space on this computer, I'd definitely recommend an external if you're doing any multimedia. There's also an HDMI out, which is wonderful, but there's no VGA out, so if you're planning to use this for presentations you might need to get an adapter.

This 15R has strong wi-fi and bluetooth, picking up and holding onto signals better. I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Onkyo-CS-355-CD-Hi-Fi-Mini-System-with-Bluetooth/dp/B008YDTSFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Onkyo CS-355 CD Hi-Fi Mini System with Bluetooth</a>. The bluetooth signals from other laptops I tried would be very, very tentative.  Move the wrong way, signal is lost. Sit the wrong way (like with the laptop on your lap) it would lose the signal.  With this laptop, it's consistent and strong.  Another one of those minor strengths that points to the overall build quality of this laptop and the components they are using.  In other words, they're not shoving in cheap and sketchy components just in order to boast about features. The features work and they work well.

The memory is 6GB, which is probably the minimum for good running computers these days, however, it's easily upgraded. It often costs more to have higher memory upfront than to upgrade later.

Video works solid, HD though not the highest resolution. Honestly, you probably won't notice. I don't notice a big difference between my computer and my wife's, which has a dedicated video card and higher resolution. Such dedicated cards take away battery life and add complexity to the system, resulting in more problems.

The touchscreen itself is great. Multi-touch, meaning it can sense at least ten points of contact. I only have 10 fingers, so that's all I was willing to test.  Very sensitive, very fluid. There are good apps that do make use of it well.

My one complaint has to do with the screen. Very glossy which means very reflective. Turn it on and you're looking at yourself in a reflection. It has good brightness, so mostly overcomes this, but if you're working outside a lot, this might be an issue.

All in all, I'm exceedingly pleased with this model. I'm not entirely sold on touchscreen necessity yet, but the great thing about this is it's a bit more future-proofed should software (like Word or Powerpoint!) be increasingly more touchscreen optimized.  It makes for a great bridge between a traditional laptop and a workable tablet like access. Great for school or work.  It has worked well with all the software I've used and that includes Microsoft Office, the new Adobe Suite, Corel Painter, and other multimedia. Not a glitch, or a problem to note at all.

Highly recommend if you're looking for a workhorse laptop with a touchscreen.",5,False,"10 8, 2013"

Amazon Customer,"I bought this to make mini arcade machines for Christmas. While that worked out ok to a certain extent, there are issues that should be noted. I really would prefer to give this 2.5 stars, it's just under the ""OK"" rating. Here's the issues.

This runs as a framebuffer device... meaning: it's slow.
When running an emulator on HDMI, the Raspberry Pi blazes,  but displaying on this LCD saps about 75% of the frame rate away. Since I was making novelty devices, it's ok. Well, not really ""OK"", it'll pass, and that's the best you can say.

This LCD is more suited to displaying static images. When trying to run X-Windows, the resolution is so low you can't access the window controls, like close and scroll or the ok buttons.

The case is really nicely designed, BUT..... I have received four of them, and EVERY ONE comes out of the package broke.

Furthermore when using the case (open and closing), parts just crumble off of it. While it looks lovely, I suspect that when they laser-cut the case, it destroys the temper of the plastic and makes it insanely brittle.

I wrote the company about broken case #1. They promptly sent me a new one from China. And yes, upon opening the box and bag, inside were once again, broken pieces.  You don't even have to open the bag and you can see broken parts tumbling around inside. The case is as fragile as if it were made from baked sugar.

So.... What you can or must do is; hot-glue the crumbling case together and then it serves it's purpose of holding the screen and Raspberry Pi, more or less. Don't bother asking for a replacement, you'll just get more broken parts.

If you just need a small screen that's clear and works and can deal with gluing a crumbling case together, then is actually isn't a bad choice. I think it's quite expensive and for the premium price you should get a premium product, but its definitely not there.

On the other hand, options are limited. So get it for the screen, recognize it's low rez and a bit slow, and replace the case. If that meets your criteria, then it's great.",3,True,"01 6, 2016"

Nathan,"I have a Cooler Master Storm Sniper, which has pretty ridiculous airflow, so cooling results may vary. I also am a tiny bit of an MSI fanboy. Been buying their cards since the 460 cyclone, and have never had an issue (Even with the 460. Being used in girlfriend's build now).
With that preface out of the way, let's get into the card.

Pros:
-Solid construction. Not even a hint of sagging after a few months.
-Great cooling. I have my two cards separated by about 1.5 inches of space, and the upper card never goes above 75c (I do have a fairly aggressive fan profile, though).
-Great color scheme, and even looks good from the side.
-Overclocks well (With a custom fan profile through MSI Afterburner, I can easily keep this guy cooled with a 10% overclock on the core. I never bother with the vram).
-I used just one for a while on my 1440p monitor, and it ran Crysis 3 nearly smoothly (never dipping below about 45 fps), without 2x AA. With 2, it's ridiculous. 60+ fairly solidly with all settings on their highest.
-Single card couldn't handle Witcher 2 with ubersampling. 2 does easily.

Cons:
-The frame gets in the way of the sli bridge, a bit. If you have a non-flexible one, I could see there being a bit of an issue.
-They get a bit loud, even with the stock fan profile. Nothing ridiculous, though. Right about the same volume as my friend's Windforce.
-Can't see the red from the side. I'm never sure what the point of a colored bottom on a cooler is.

Overall, this is a great partner board for the 780. If you're debating about which card to get in this price range, you might want to look at AMD, though. I got my 780's back when the R9 290 prices were inflated from the bitcoin craze.

Not only were they simple to put on and we all know they protect the body of the kindle from greasy fingers etc but the picture I chose is more brilliant than I realise.  The skin I refer to is the one I am reviewing now, so if you imagine this one on your kindle then you can appreciate the wonder I felt when it actually became a scene from the book I am reading!!!  So naturally that is what I mean when I say that purchasing the (correct) skin for your kindle will not only protect your kindle but enhance your reading experience at the same time!!!

Rod,"It is a nice remote controller. It took me minutes to start using my devices with this remote. There was one remote that I need to learn completely, very easy and relatively fast. The learned commands have 100% Yield.

The pages allow you to control up to 10 devices however they are  pre-organized wich is not the best for all applications, there is no way to move devices from one page to another easly. You need to do it in a hard way. First you need to edit every tag on the Main Page (the manual doesn't say exactly how to do it, but the web page does) and then program the right codes but also you need to write it down all pages tags and then edit all the text pages which is time consuming because if you program a DVD where a TV tag was, all the TV page remain even if you specify that in that tag you are programming a DVD (one star less for this).

At the end I was able control and organize the way I wanted. I'm thinking to buy another one to clone it in order to have one in every room. The clone function it's a good idea.

There is no computer interface. It might be good to backup all the effort you may need to do such the thigs like I did. I think it's possible to clone the remote through the IrDA of the PC but that function is not available.",4,True,"01 11, 2007"

Christopher,"The resolution and size of the screen on this camera is absolutely incredible. Pictures and video look really sharp. Screen is anti-reflective too. HD video is outstanding. Taped a table tennis match, the video and sound were both extremely clear and the movement was incredibly smooth, due to the 30 fps. I am not so impressed with camera's auto mode, while indoors, yet.  Colors were off, maybe due to the white balance and low light. I find myself using the ""P"" mode mostly and making small adjustments to the white balance and adjusting the ""my colors"" section.  Overall its a beautiful looking camera and feels good in the hands. I like the two tone color scheme. You have to watch your fingers, on your left, hand so they don't block the flash, it's very easy to do.

Update: Digital Zoom.
Most people advise you to disable digital zoom because of the resolution degradation when using it, however on this camera the digital zoom is fantastic, with very little resolution degradation seen and digital zoom can be used while in Video mode.

Update Foliage Program mode,8/2009:
I have been using the foliage mode for outdoor scenic shots lately.  In this mode the greens, blues, are brilliantly enhanced making scenic pics pop out with bright color, some may like or dislike for the colors do not represent the true colors viewed.  I like this mode,  especially if the light your shooting in is not right, this mode will brighten the colors and make your photo less boring.  I recommend previewing each shot before you move on to make sure the colors are not too saturated. I found that as the light changes this may happen.

Update: March 2010

DEW326,"First, this is an expensive TV (even when buying it from Amazon's Warehouse on sale) so I would expect it to have a great picture. It does not disappoint. I moved back to Samsung LED after having a Panasonic 54"" plasma for six years. I still have the plasma, but it has been moved to the bedroom. I wanted a larger screen and was intrigued with the new 4K curved screen technology. The picture to my highly untrained eye is very good (on par with the plasma) The plasma advantage is the view from the side. While the LED picture is still sharp and clear when viewed from the side, it washes out and does not have the vivid colors you see when viewed head on (thus the 4 star rating). Since I am the only one watching the TV, the side view does not enter into play. I tried a 3-D movie (Mad Max Fury Road) and again, the picture was as good to my eye as the plasma. I initially tried to adjust the picture settings to conform to a review website's recommendations. After a week of viewing, I went back and reset to factory options with the Movie mode set, Color Tone at Warm 1 and Auto Motion at Clear. So far I like this configuration.
The curved screen doesn't seem to enter into play as much as I thought it would (my normal viewing distance is 10' and I think you need to be closer to experience the immersive effect they claim with the curved screen). I haven't had the chance to view any 4K media, so I can't speak to that aspect of this TV, but I have to believe that the 4K ability does enhance the over all picture.",4,True,"01 4, 2016"

Arpit Patel,"Seeing as how this product has been around a while, it seems many of the reviews are a bit older. There are a couple changes that you should be aware of:

-This mouse no longer ships with a travel/carrying pouch/case.
-It comes with only a micro USB cable, not the USB extension cable for the receiver it used to come with.
-The battery included is an AA NiMH ""ReCyKo"" 2050 mAh battery (not the Eneloop it previously came with). As far as I can tell, inserting any other type of (non NiMH) AA battery will be fine, as long as you don't try to charge it.

Most of rest of the features have been thoroughly reviewed, here and on many other sites (many video reviews available too). I agree with most, keeping in mind how you feel about the size depends on how you hold it, and how big your hand is. It is certainly very comfortable for me, as I often rest my palm on the mouse, rather than the table.

A couple things I didn't see mentioned by others:
-It now only comes with the mouse, receiver, micro USB cable, and a battery.
-The scroll wheel (in the regular mode) has less-than-average friction when I am turning the wheel. One video review described it as ""mushy"". Though it is noticeable, I got used to it after a couple days, and it doesn't bother me at all. The freewheel mode works as advertised with almost no friction, but is a little too sensitive for day-to-day use (i.e. the page may stutter if you try to rest your finger on the wheel)
-The scroll wheel tilt left and right is pressure sensitive: tilt it harder, it will scroll horizontally faster. I've noted at least 5 discrete pressure levels/speeds, but I'm not sure how many distinct steps it has.
-Tilting the wheel doesn't ""click"" when you push it, so in certain cases, you might not be sure if you're activating it or not. Again, not a deal-breaker, but I'm not sure I would re-map this ""button"", as it would make the pressure sensitivity useless, and I would prefer a physical ""click"" if I were going to use it for other
-Storing the unifying receiver: While there is technically no designated storage space for the receiver, it will easily fit above the battery (see picture) within the compartment. Just be careful not to push it far in, it can get stuck in there.",4,True,"12 25, 2015"

G. Ware Cornell Jr.,"My wife is geographically challenged. I grew up in South Florida, where we live, and she grew up in Toronto where we don't live. I suppose sending me out for bread in Toronto might become as interesting as what happens when my wife goes shopping in the vast flat malls of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, but somehow I doubt it. Like my father before me, I have the unerring ability to find a slum on any continent without trying very hard.

Hence this Tom Tom GPS. This is actually the second one I have bought her. The first was from that amazingly bad generation of GPS devices which constantly screamed ""GO BACK! GO BACK!"" which was really freaky if you didn't know where you were going and annoying if you did. This little baby just assumes you know where you are going, within reason, and quickly recalculates your route.

Connecting to Google is cool. In this town things change rapidly, new restaurants open, new stores get hot, and the older GPS are clueless. With a Google connection, you are on your way. If you want you can update your own maps, but unless you are a cartographer, why would you want to?

Rust Never Sleeps,"The Zalman NC-1000 is perfect in every way -- but is designed for laptops/notebooks up to 15.75 inches wide ONLY !!
 Zalman also has the NC-1500 and the NC-2000 models that are for the larger-size laptops/notebooks.
 Check with the Manufacturer (Zalman) for their recommendations for your size requirements before ordering.
 I purchased two NC-1000B coolers for my kids' DELL 1525s -- and they work perfectly to cool the laptops (even at the beach, on the hottest of days!).
 I noticed that many reviewers complain about insufficient cooling when the unit is used on a bed, blanket, or other non-flat, cloth surface. This is NOT the fault of the computer OR the Zalman NC coolers -- it's simply that the user's common sense has taken a vacation !!!
 In order to function as designed, ALL laptop/notebooks and cooler pads should be used ONLY on a smooth, flat surface -- or you risk serious damage to your cooler and/or your computer !!
 One reviewer suggested placing a piece of corrugated board or a piece of plywood under the cooler when it is to be used on a bed or on your lap -- which will work fine, BUT -- the smart bird uses his computer ONLY on a table, desk, or other solid, flat surface.
 For those who think that the Zalman NC-1000 is too expensive -- there is such a thing as ""the economy of quality"", which means that a long-lasting, well-made product's higher initial cost will be nullified by the extended service, better performance, and increased reliability of the quality product.

Phil,"I ordered the Energy Power Bar Soundbar for my grandmother a few months ago. I liked the shorter size of the soundbar because it was going to be set on a fireplace mantle beneath the TV that was mounted on the wall along with a Blu-ray player. My initial reaction to this soundbar was that it felt ultra-cheap relative to what I paid for it. I was disappointed from the start.

After I had hooked everything up, we tested the soundbar with the movie Terminator Salvation on Blu-ray. The sound was OK but nothing mind blowing. The first issue I had was that there is NO remote - this unit will learn commands from your TV remote. Normally this would be perfect for someone elderly and/or not very tech savvy, but my grandmother has a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Harmony-650-Remote-Control-Silver/dp/B004OVECU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Harmony 650 Remote Control (Silver)</a>&nbsp;which she learned to use pretty quickly so I wanted to stick with that setup. I guess one could program the soundbar to use the TV remote commands, but this is definitely more of a hassle than having a unit with a dedicated remote and a profile already loaded in the Logitech software.

As far as features go, I felt the unit was severely lacking there as well. I'm not a huge fan of the surround modes on other units, but this is a unit with on, off and volume controls - nothing else. There isn't even dynamic volume control or anything like that, which is definitely useful in an apartment! Plus, it only had  optical and RCA inputs - no HDMI like other, (much) cheaper units have.

If you have a TV that has NO other components hooked up to it, and you want to control the soundbar and TV with just the TV remote alone, AND you want something ultra basic, then perhaps I could see getting something like this soundbar. But for this price, no - I wouldn't even pay a hundred bucks for this unit. To me, relative to the high price, I felt this soundbar lacked too many features, and the components felt like cheap plastic and fiberboard junk. I'm not sure I can honestly state one feature this soundbar has over almost every other soundbar available, except MAYBE the smaller size. It didn't even come with a wall mounting bracket.

Ultimately, I had to return this soundbar because the sub-woofer had a rattle (I probably would have anyway). I don't think it had anything rattling around in it - I think the speaker itself was defective. I decided to order a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-HW-E450-Wireless-AirTrack-Sound-Bar/dp/B0076U29LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung HW-E450 Wireless AirTrack Sound Bar</a>&nbsp;to replace it, which, at the time was almost 40% cheaper and had a ton of nice features over the Energy, like an HDMI input with ARC support and dynamic range controls. Plus, it sounded great! If I lived in an apartment or shared housing, I would definitely buy a Samsung soundbar for myself. My grandmother sure loves her home theater setup.

K. Horton,"We purchased this item 2 years ago and installed 4 Western Digital Caviar 1 TB drive. The unit was very easy to install and configure with Time Machine using the Drobo's proprietary disk formatting. That part is great. One of the disks failed and we simply replaced it with a 2TB drive and the data was rebuilt - just as advertised. However, it took 3 days. We currently back up 3.25 TB of data.

Now to the really bad part. Every 6 months Time Machine announces that the Drobo is write protected and no more backups can be made. We run the Apple disk utilities and find our that the Apple system (Leopard) does indeed think the Drobo is write protected. We run Disk Warrior which is also unable to change the disk permissions. After running the Apple disk utilities, we get a message that the disk (Drobo) is unusable and we should try to salvage (my words) the data. After this happens, we cannot mount the Drobo. Note that the disks themselves are physically OK.

Our only option has been to reformat the Drobo using the Drobo Dashboard and start again. And we are good for approximately 6 months. Related to reformatting the unit, one issue we have always grappled with is how large a partition to make the entire unit. We have been creating a partition that is the ultimate size we WILL make the Drobo, that is, 8TBs. The information on the Drobo site does not really make it crystal clear what the trade-offs are. There is copius documentation for this unit, but I find it fails to address some of these small but important decision a user must make.

This is not a very comforting state of affairs. To top it off, we have found technical support to be pretty much useless. It always comes down to repairing the permissions on our main Mac HD. We have asked repeatedly why this would make any difference since no programs are installed on the Drobo.

What we found extremely upsetting was our experience with Drobo technical support during this last incident of write-protection problems. It took one week to receive an answer with diagnostic questions. We immediately asnwered the quaestions and waited another week for a reply. We gave up after the third week and just reformatted the Drobo as we had done in the past.

In short:

Time-Machine problems: There seems to be a Time Machine issue with this Drobo. We have a Drobo FS used for network shares with no problems.

Slow transfer rate: Upgrading one of four drives from 1 TB to 2 TB takes over 3 days.

Performing a fresh Time-Machine backup of 3TBs data takes 3 days.

Noise: The fan is noisey, but not a big deal

Technical support: Spotty. Once in a while you will get a help technician.

On the plus side: Drobo does make it easy to replace or upgrade the individual drives.

We ultimately will need to demote this unit and get a G-Technology 8TB RAID.",2,True,"04 19, 2011"

J. Russell,"This is a very inexpensive FM Transmitter. It has none of the more expensive design require to have a very good dynamic range of volume without distortion (static) and full utilization of the low maximum power(distance)FCC allows for these private FM Broadcast devices, 1Watt I believe.

If you have a more-or-less fixed setup of location and volume, then you might get away with this cheaper device by adjusting its lead wire (mp3/audio source connection) and input volume from audio source to get static free sound and adequate distance. But don't try to move it much afterward, or change source volume, cause you will get static in sound again. Also, you must adjust input volume with transmitter positioned where it will stay, and your hand not near it, because your hand increases its antenna pickup and hence its reception volume.

Bottom line, most will find this Transmitter not worth fooling around with. In its defense, most all transmitters in this price range, and even some more expensive, are cheaper designs and just do not work well in varying environments.

I can recommend the Scosche Model SMT4, here on Amazon [...] from personal experience. How their other models, some specifically designed for automobile use, I cannot vouch for without experience. But this portable SMT4 has proved to be a highly reliable, excellent input vol range without static, no vol change with hand holding(antenna sensitivity), and works very well with rechargeable batteries. I originally had my Scosche, but needed another Transmitter for another application and was hoping to get off cheap. Didn't work!

TIPS: Keep in mind, FCC limits these personal FM Broadcast devices to very low power so yours does not interfere with your neighbors 50 feet away. Their operating distance is further limited by interference from strong local commercial FM Broadcast Stations (this is obviously a bigger issue when you are traveling in a car). It is therefore an advantage to have a Transmitter that you can change its transmitting frequency, the more stations the better. Don't expect to get more than about 10Ft of reliable operation even in the best of fixed situations. A tip in setting Transmitters frequency in a fixed location where maximum range is wanted, use another digitally tuned FM Radio to tune to local FM Stations and find a frequency that has either low or no reception over four or five digital tuning increments (no local broadcast station pickup), the more the better. Set your Transmitter to the center frequency of this not busy frequency range. Obviously you want to do this around frequencies your Transmitter can be set to broadcast.",2,False,"09 20, 2012"
Michelle Lynn,This thing broke as soon as we took it out of the box. Literally the antenna snapped off with a slight left to right adjustment. Unfortunately it only cost around $9 and its not worth shipping back for a refund. Don't bother. This thing is so light that the base can barely hold the antennae.

A Funny Girl,"I LOVE my iPad mini.  I upgraded from the original iPad 1 and so the differences of these two devices are truly night and day.
I remember when I first got my iPad 1, thinking it was so lightweight and portable and now it just seems so oversized and bulky.  However, that original iPad is still kicking!  If it weren't for the lack of updates and preventing from using a lot of the current apps AND the fact that I had a strip where I had messed up the pixels I probably owuld have been content to carry on with the original iPad.

The iPad mini is just truly a breath of fresh air.  I had contemplated getting a bigger screen, but really found that I didn't feel I needed a huge screen to perform the tasks I needed on a daily basis.  The iPad mini is truly so much easier to slide in your purse and use on the go.  The weight of this device is almost like carrying air.  It's just so easy and trust me I have this device in my hands almost every second of everyday.  It literally is glued to me at all times.

The camera isn't the BEST, but it's better than you'll find on similar devices like the Fire.  It's much clearer and crisper than what you would expect a tablet to have.

I have the 16 GB and honestly, it was fine for awhile, however with how often iOS updates I would recommend never purchasing below 32 GB.  I had a 32 GB on my original iPad and still managed to run out of space (Don't even think of having movies stored on your devices each movie is at least 1 GB and that seriously is a huge chunk of storage space).

The screen is just so bright and clear.  I didn't think it could get better than the original ipad and man, technology just keeps making things better and better and better.  It's amazing the thigns you can see when you zoom in with your camera because of the high definition of the screen.

I love the multitasking on the ipad.  Just everything about the iPad is top notch to me.  I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 3 7"" tablet last year and was so disappointed at how slow it was and how it just didn't perform well and was always crashing.

The iPad mini has crashed more often than I experienced in the early days of the iPad original, I'm not really sure why that is...  However, iOS is still a much more stable system than androids are.  I am so much more confident of my information being safe and secure than I am on any other operating system.  I just don't seem to have the same issues with iOS devices as I do with android or windows.

If you are wanting a tablet to use as your primary internet device, than I definitely recommend iOS and the iPads because they just truly peform better than anything out there.  Fire tablets are nice, but you are so limited as to what you can do on them and they just don't even come close to being on the same playing field as the iPad.

The ONE thing that I am not so crazy about is the charging cable that iPads use now.  I never had any issues with my cables on the iPad Original, the bigger charger just seemed to be more stable than the lightening one is.  I've gone through about 7 cords this year.  I don't know what the deal is with them.",5,False,"02 7, 2015"

Lban,"I originally bought the 17"" Swiss Army wheeled computer case which works great except when all the overhead compartments are full in an overbooked flight, which seemingly more common these days.  Unfortunately, my fully loaded case would not fit under the seat so I'd have to either put it on my lap or dreadfully check it.

This 16"" Solo case holds the same amount of stuff (tightly) and fits under the seat with ease.  It doesn't have wheels, but the case itself is light so carrying it via strap is not a problem.

It looks great and is quite versatile.  Looks just fine dressed up in a suit and tie, or dressed down in flip-flops and cargo shorts.

They also stock them in Staples if you wanted to go someplace and see it before you buy it online.

~~06Mar2016~~
I still use it daily.  I will tweak your back and shoulder if you overload this bag and are in a long transit (long trip of multiple layovers / transfers).

Strap finally gave out but I found one in the shop and just took the brown padding off the original strap and put it on the new one.  One of the front snap buckle things is temperamental and works 90% of the time.  Not bad for 6 years of use/abuse.  Seams still intact and leather has not faded or rubbed into my clothing.  Nothing split or torn.",5,True,"07 25, 2010"
Eli,"Bought the system in early 2011...obvious, this is a ""while supplies last"" as SLS is no longer making home audio equipment.

The systems come with everything...AV-rec, 5 speakers and a sub woofer, cables, and speaker stands.

The speakers are really outstanding. First, these speakers are very well built and very sturdy. They can be floor/shelf speakers with stand or flush mounted on the wall. Most important, these speakers sound great. Very clear and excellent high and mid range sound and decent base even without the sub woofer. Definately the best part of the deal is these speakers.

I don't have a huge amount of experience with sub-woofers, but this one seems to be pretty good. I have very little doubt that there are better ones out there, but this one produces more than enough clear and accurate base for my 16 x 18 foot room.

The AV receiver doesn't have HDMi connection, which is a drawback and now is about 6 years old. But the quality of the sound is outstanding...has optical connections (2),Coaxial optical, component and RCA connections, etc...plenty of options if HDMi isn't essential. I will upgrade the receiver in a year or two.

Cons...older receiver w/no HDMi. Speakers aren't true surround...all five are identical (but sound great).",5,False,"03 15, 2011"

Once a user gets a ""handle"" on the functions and processes, I think it can be used without much effort or confusion.  No matter how proficient you become, I think it will require hand & eye coordination rather than using it blindly with only the feel of your hands.  It is slim and slick, so keep a good hold on it. However, it seems well built and robust.

I think based on its benefits and price this is a 5-star.

I love the idea of the wireless cameras. We use them in a house so I don't know what the max range is. We have no reception issues, period.
Now For the bad news !!!
If you are going to use a remote view there are issues. The monitor has 2 outputs. 1 is a Combo TV/Video output. The other is a USB computer output. When using either the Lorex monitor does not work. It's not supposed to. I wish it did. Also, using the USB port only access' Camera #1. If you use Skype to Monitor online (Yes that works fine) You are stuck with only Camera #1 or you must install/configure a video card. With the video output you can use the 4 camera feature. You can do this with Skype but it may take a bit of tinkering, depending on your system. I used a couple of refurbished Dell desktops and a PCI video card (all purchased thru Amazon) be sure you have lots of RAM on your computer (Wouldn't hurt to upgrade that while you're doing all this stuff, never can have too much memory). The video quality suffers some via the video card.  The system works and I am able to check on an elderly parent who lives alone several times a day. Gives great piece of mind to the family. (They can all visit with her via video anytime they want from across the USA). If Lorex would do a firmware update to make this thing work 4 camera/USB, It would be a fantastic system.

Estabot MKIII,"I bought a used unit. Packaging was all almost new, the item itself had a couple very small <1 cm marks which were hardly noticeable.
The watch itself requires the Pebble app to properly connect to your phone and manage the watch's features. It has it's own little app store which is simple enough to browse and I've managed to find plenty of fun and useful apps. The available watch faces are also fantastic (currently rolling with the Pip-Boy 100 watch face). The watch is 100% waterproof and the screen is very clear and legible with proper lighting (it does have a decent back light but it's not dazzlingly bright). While it lacks a touch-screen, the physical buttons are very easy to work with and can be programmed to work as shortcuts (activating by pressing and holding for a couple seconds). It will track your sleep and steps accurately and even gives you little positive notes on your progress. The weather feature is also quite nice and syncs with the Weather Channel, plus it has some rudimentary music controls (skip, pause/play, volume). Battery life varies but I've had an average of 3-4 days with moderate use.
The one issue I have is the software support is questionable as Pebble Tech Co was bought by Fitbit and basically shut down (from what I've read). So the future of this device in terms of official support is doubtful. That said, there seems to be a decent following that plans to create third party support. But I don't honestly know that much about it.

Andre,"Ok, so this is probably the happiest review I'll ever give!! I'm not gonna lie the hype was a bit much and lets just say I was fooled before.. (beats) So after a while of waiting and reading I decided to pull the trigger and boy was I happy. The first thing you notice is the size and weight and the second thing you notice is that it doesnt matter. They are huge huge cans but you could care-a-less once the music starts. These are as close to perfect as one can get for under a grand. They are literally do-it-all headphones.

I'll admit I am a bit of a bass head but clearly I'm not dumb (clearly). Bass is very very important to me but I still need substance not just sub bass. I didn't know what to expect because I was once told that V-Moda's had amazing bass and then traded them back in two days after I got them because of how weak they were so when I read that these ""had"" the bass that I was looking for I was a little skeptical but wanted to give them a shot nonetheless.. And again.. WOW.. The impact, the speed and the depth is pretty amazing and oh so clean.. Are there other headphones that hit harder for the money or less?? Of course!! The Ultrasone Pro 900 are the first to come to mind but do can the Pro's hold the 400's lets say ""magnets"" (you guys know what I mean) not even close!! The overall sound signature of the pro's is kitty litter compared to the Hifiman's. They managed to find the perfect balance and no part of the sound bleeds into the other but there is still enough bass for your everyday (now) upscale bass-head to love.

Of couse the first thing I did when I was on the road to buy the headphones was to buy the replacement velour ear pads from Head-direct.com ([...]) and that was the smartest thing I could have done. Say goodbye to the dreaded ear sweat and swampy feeling you get from the leather pads and hello better isolation and comfort. I actually like the sound a lot better with the velour pads. Gives it added depth and the highs seem to come through a little easier as well.

The only and I mean only semi-complaint with these is that there is open back and then there's these.. Trust me when I say anyone seated within 6-12 feet from you will be able hear everything you are listening to down to the smallest detail, 100% sound leakage but still these aren't really made for on the move even though they can be run by portable devises.. That being said I would strongly suggest that you get yourself an amp Fiio e11/17, iBasso T5/D12, or Headstage Arrow 12 HE 4G to make this bad boy sing. The DB level is fairly low on these so most if not all portable devies will not have enough kick to get the most out of the He-400 so do yourself a favor and plan on getting an amp to go along with this badboys.

Ok, time to stop reading and start buying! You will not regret it and be prepared for one of the best pairs of headphones on the market right now regardless of the price range.

i have never wrote bad review.
and this is the first.
i bought this Simran unit for 900W product and it just doesn't work.
i tested it with multi meter and found that the 1600W option
return between 40V-70V instead of 110V-120V.
the 50W option works fine.
bottom line if you need to use it for product with more than 50W
this is just doesn't work!

Thud,"Risk taken, lesson learned. The battery does not fit completely into the laptop. I can't figure out where it is hitting, mostly in the area around the connector, but will not fit exactly like the original. Secondly, the battery will never reach a full charge. Even when following directions to ""condition"" the battery, complete discharge then completely recharge battery. Well, after doing this, the battery starts up at 99% and even when leaving connected to power source, it never reaches 100% like the OEM battery. Finally, the battery will not hold a charge nearly as long as the OEM battery (roughly 3 hours of light ""surfing"" use. I don't know if this is because the connection is not quite right (because it does not fit tight), or because of some internal issue. No manufacture date listed on product so it may just be old stock. Therefore in conclusion, I would recommend purchasing a direct replacement from HP since they are now only a few dollars different. I would have done this if not for Prime. I would have returned it, but by the time you spend money on shipping, there is no guarantee that the replacement would be any better and I would still be in the same situation but with more money spent.",2,True,"06 21, 2016"

Y. Chen,"The bluetooth adaptor is not compatible with my Bose wireless headphone when I install the adapter in my Window 7 64-bit Professional Dell business laptop. There is no error during the installation. The pairing seems ok and my PC does show the headphone in the device list. But that is the end. The device remains disconnected. I contact the customer service via e-mail. They are very responsive. Here is the suggestion from the customer service. You can try this first before you contact them for connection issue.

Lets remove all paired devices and then do a full uninstall and reinstall of the WIDCOMM Bluetooth software:
Uninstall the BTD-400 driver from the Device Manger. The BTD-400 should be plugged in.
Locate and open Control Panel > Device Manager
Under the Device Manager, locate Bluetooth Radios > BCM2070
Right click the device, and select Properties
Navigate to the Driver tab, and click the Uninstall button. Be sure to check the box so the driver can be deleted from the computer.
Hit OK and close out of the windows when it is complete
Unplug the BTD-400
Uninstall all WIDCOMM and Bluetooth related software
Restart your computer
Install the driver from the software included on the CD. The drivers can also be downloaded from here  http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php
Next, we should ensure that the Bluetooth services are running:
Click on the Start button and type in Services in the search box. Click on Services when it appears in the menu.
Locate Bluetooth Service from the list and verify that the status is Started and startup type is set to Automatic.
Next, locate Bluetooth Support Service from the list and verify that the status is Started and startup type is set to Automatic or Manual.
If not, right click the entry and select Properties. Select Automatic from the Startup type drop down list.
Hit Start if it is not grayed out then press OK.
Restart your computer and see if issues still persist after making changes.
If you still cant pair devices to your computer, the Bluetooth Support Services may not have the correct permissions set:
Right click on the Bluetooth Support Service and select Properties
Go to the Log on tab.
If Local System is checked, this is the source of the problem. Select This Account
Type in Local Service. When you click okay it will say select valid password or such. This is NOT a problem
Delete the password dots (a 15-dot-string) under Password and delete the string under confirm (both password boxes are now empty).
Click Ok. It should then tell you to Stop the service and then to Restart the service before the change takes effect. It should now work.
If you're not able to hear sound from the paired and connected headphones or speaker, they may not be set as the default playback device. Normally Windows will switch to the Bluetooth device once its been paired and connected, but sometimes Windows won't do that. We can check by doing the following:
Right click the Volume control tray icon then select Playback devices from the context menu.
Select the Headphones (Bluetooth Hands-free Audio by left clicking the device then click Set Default.
Hit OK to close the window. The headphones should now play audio from your computer.

I cannot see my headphone in the ""Playback devices"". The headphone works great with Apple products. So finally I was asked to call the customer service. They can remote login to my machine to check my configuration. The gentleman on the other side is very professional. He concluded that it is compatibility issue with the Broadcom chip they use. They will offer me a refund. And I was advised to try a different brand that does not use Broadcom chip, such as CSR chip.

I will give the product one star since it does not work for me. But I would give the customer service 5 stars. The compatibility issue should vary from device to device. It should not prevent you from buying their products because they will try their best to resolve your issues.",3,True,"01 13, 2016"

After playing with it for a while, I noticed you have to trigger it RIGHT IN FRONT of the infrared sensor on your camera, NOT on the other side, ONLY the infrared sensor side - how silly?! I was shooting some interior shots (no one in the picture) and was hoping that I can trigger the shot behind the camera - No, it simply doesn't work that way. On the other hand you have to be so close to the camera to get it working. I needed to make sure the trigger is less than a feet away in order to get it working...

A.C.H.,"OK, first the good news:
  * When it works*, it works well enough
  * Netflix
  * Can eliminate rental fees to your cable company

The bad news:
  * Usability problems
  * Occasionally can't tune a channel (""weak signal"")
  * Quality control issues

A few of the usability problems:
  * You can't enter numbers to skip to channels while browsing through the guide -- you have to exit the guide first, type in the number, and then re-enter
  * Doesn't reliably remember last channel -- about 80% of the time, when turning on the box you'll be tuned to channel 1 (or 2, I don't remember which).  This is a basic feature that should work 100% of the time.
  * You need internet connectivity to even bring up the guide, even if you successfully retrieved the listings earlier (or if your wireless card goes bad, see below).

As for quality control... about a week ago the box suddenly started telling me that no internet connection was available.  I tried to go through the wireless setup again, and it couldn't find any networks, and would constantly kick me back to the main settings screen.  Occasionally throughout the week I found that the box had set it back to ""Wired"".  I called Samsung tech support, and based on this info the rep confidently declared that the wireless card was going bad (I'm guessing this is a common issue).  I'm getting an RMA, but seeing as this issue started less than 2 months after I bought the box I have zero confidence that the replacement will last either.",2,False,"08 18, 2014"

Bo Lorentzen,"Maybe Im spoiled, but I have come to expect delicious materials and innovative designs in anything iPad.

Don't know what surprise me most, the fact that so many people seems to love this case, or how few times I have used it.

The case is OK,  shockingly un-inspired form follows function kind of stuff, and with no particularly exciting design solutions.

The main feature is naturally the keyboard, it is one of those one-sheet rubber jobs, no click feeling just a mush, people use these in work-environments, so this might work well as a ipad case for a contractor.  but trust me, no self respecting writer or geek is going to be typing the next American novel on this thing.

As mentioned, the case is OK, all pleather, plastic leather ""whatever"" material, it looks less cheap than it feel, which is a reassuring thing I guess.

So I really tried to use this,  when I arrived I dumped my iPad into the case and paired the keyboard,  used it for about 1 hour then pulled the iPad back out and put away the case... a few days later I loaned it to a iPad loving friend, a election worker on the road all the time, it was returned after 2 days with a ""mjah"" you can keep it.
Then I tried really hard, used it for a full day, then loaned it to my girlfriend who also returned it..

You get the idea,  this is not working for me, and have entered the pile of ""stuff"" I have bought at a moment of excitement for the iPad.  Maybe one of the problems is that the reason to use it may be some kind of ""laptop envy""?  adding a keyboard to the iPad makes it bigger, clunkier and heavier, suddenly I might as well grab a notebook computer with more serious horsepower and software.

For now my solution is a perfectly wonderful apple BT keyboard, which is great to type on, I simply prop up the iPad when using it.  the KB travels in the bottom of my suitcase but do get used now and then.

Just my personal opinion, the keyboard is OK and works but the keys are mushy, the case is fine if you like pleather, I just don't like it and it don't fit the way I use my iPad.  I would probably not really recommend this to a friend.",2,True,"12 3, 2010"
j-rob-82,"I am new to high definition camcorders and I really looked forward to getting this one since I have been using a Sony DV camera for about 4 years now. First the bad, when I received it the first thing I noticed was how Sony was stingy on accessories like no remote, no good software, no firewire support(oh come on Sony),no good instructions, no mini hdmi, no memory stick, no bigger better life battery. You would think for a $1400 camera they would of thrown something in. Since I had already had a Sony camcorder I was already used to the interface and how to get to certain  aspects of the camera so I never really read the instructions but a first timer may have problems with it.

  In low light conditions this camcorder chokes and quality gets bad so you have to do some adjusting. Focusing for it also became a problem in low light. I noticed if I changed exposure or brightness to much the shot would get jerky. I am still looking for a way to fix this.

  I wish the lens was a little wider and the optical zoom a little more. Digital zoom in my mind is worthless unless you have it set up on a tripod b/c you gotta have a robotic steady arm to keep it still. I usually only use optical zoom but noticed even when I zoomed all the way with it the picture would start to shutter and degrade.

The camera part is good if you currently don't have a camera but my Sony Cybershot is more simple to use and has better quality and easier to use than getting the camcorder out to take pictures. You can tell from the quality it is not a 10.2 mega pixel but merely face value on the camcorder to help sell. Its pretty nice to have it on the camcorder in case you want to take quick pictures. With my DV camera I could take digital stills from the video and quality wasn't that good of course so I was expecting this $1400 camcorder to really shine but so far digital stills are sub par. Hopefully as I get more experience with it I will learn tricks to fix this. The menus were easier to navigate in my DV camera as well. I am not sure exactly what I need 5.1 surround on a camcorder for but its still nice to have. I will probably do something later with it.

  My final complaint is a lack of software to import AVCHD and so far I have found 3. Looking at reviews of the software the best I have found that is affordable is Sony Vegas 8 platinum. I would like to get Pro later but as of now the cheapest I have seen it is $350.

  Other than those complaints the camcorder takes amazing film and outdoor locations look phenomenal. I have daughters 1 year old and a three year old and its nice to have a camera that records colors so vividly b/c I want to see exactly what my kids look like since my DV camera footage always looked different than reality. I find my self looking for things to record outside. Since I own a Playstation 3 I just hook it straight to that to watch on my Sony 40 inch Bravia. Some odd reason I always stick with Sony since I have had pretty good luck with them. Anyways As we watched the video I recorded outside and the camera moved sideways and the shake of my hand almost makes it throw up inducing. I haven't tried importing on my computer yet and my understanding is it takes a long time depending on quality of what was taken. I like a challenge and my computers about a year old so hopefully it won't struggle to much we'll see. I may make another review based on that.

  Some people I read didn't like the weight or size of the camcorder but I prefer being able to feel the weight b/c to me it feels more comfortable. Its not like you start to burn arm and hand fat from holding it. Its probably personal preference.

  I guess my 5 star rating comes from the overall experience from recording my family and events in their lives to just zooming in on a bees nest or just normal everyday things ,that slow motion thing is does is kinda cool. I know this camcorder will bring us joy for years to come. I usually stick with Sony products so you may find a different brand better. If you can afford it I highly recommend this. Do the research and look at other camcorders and make sure this is the exact right camcorder for you b/c what I think is great may not be what you use it for.",5,False,"06 7, 2008"

ANTHONY G.,"I couldn't be happier with this lens. If you're looking for an extremely shallow depth-of-field then this is your lens. While it's labeled as a ""wide-angle lens"" at 35mm, I have a difficult time passing this off as such in my opinion. Yes you get a good sense of your surroundings but my 20mm Pani lens gives a much wider idea of where you're shooting. Nonetheless the bokkeh is nothing short of astounding - silky smooth and easy to focus using the indented tabs for aperture and focus on the lens. I'm also impressed by the weight - it feels light and looks great on my Panasonic GH1 (with M-mount adapter purchased from eBay).

Do not confuse this with an ""action"" camera. Car cams got their start in countries where it really helped to have proof who was at fault, not just witnesses.  These mount on the dashboard and have a very wide angle view.

This model has superior optics, superior recording and a great playback display. It comes with all the accessories needed and a variety of modes from ""looped"" recording to always saving the current video, overwriting the oldest clips when it gets full. There is an ""incident button for a new video that goes in a separate incident folder and will not be overwritten when full like the others.

This model also looks nicer!  But, seriously, a camera used for ""evidence"" that is low res and choppy will not help much. Spend a bit more and get something like this that works and also fits in with modern auto decor.",5,False,"02 22, 2016"

Luigi Chincochento,"This is a replacement to an ACER that I purchased and returned.  Click on the link to ""See all of my reviews"" for that information.

Upon opening the package, I found my new ASUS Netbook, which is a cranberry/light burgundy color.  It actually looks very nice and classy; love the color.

First off, I have read some reviews where people have stated that the unit is cheap, isn't solid, etc.  I can tell you that IMHO, this is B.S.  The chiclet keyboard is nice, if you like this technology as opposed to a regular keyboard.  The unit feels VERY solid, light, user friendly, and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

Afer turning the Netbook on, Windows 7 Home Edition loaded and asked to input information in order to boot up for the first time and complete the initial setup.  Everything went smoothly, including connecting to my Home Network which I had nothing but problems with the ACER Netbook.

Everything has been removed as far as trial programs which generally go over board when you first buy a computer.  On the Netbook, there were only a few that I had to remove so offers to purchase trial software was not bad at all.

The only thing I don't like about this Netbook is the mousepad, which seems to be a common complaint with these type of computers.  Not a big deal since an external/wireless mouse will be purchased.  I just like the feel of a conventional mouse as opposed to a Netbook/Laptop Mouse pad.

I recently purchased a new Samsung TV on Amazon as well and received a free month trial to Netflix.  I did try watching a movie on the Netbook and at first, frames froze and I experienced a lot of lag.  I checked the movie settings and I had it on HD, which was the setting for my TV.  I unchecked that selection and tried again with the Netbook.  PERFECT!  Movie was smooth and played as it should.

I decided to get an ASUS again, since I also purchased an ASUS laptop earlier this year.  I have already used Technical Support and my experience was positive compared to other manufacturers.

I will paste new information and edit this review as I use the Netbook more, but so far so good.  I love it!!!",5,True,"09 3, 2011"

It has been mounted on the windshield now for the better part of a month in both hot and cold weather with varying levels of humidity and hasn't come loose.

FountainPenDiva,"After nearly six years my first generation Nook finally gave out. It had been a steady and faithful (if slightly huge) companion and my first foray into the world of e-books. I tried using the Nook app for my Nexus 7 tablet but unlike the Kindle app, it was unwieldy and rather user-unfriendly. Not to mention needing the internet to actually READ the books I already bought. So I figured it was time to invest in another Nook--the Simple Touch.  No bells and whistles. Just a good, basic touchscreen e-reader with a very clear screen.  It's a fairly light little machine, weighs about the same as my Kindle. There are two aspects that makes Nook superior to Kindle: one is the expandable memory card slot. I've always liked the ability to add e-books from other vendors to my Nook. The second is the ability to customize screensavers.  Yes, it seems like such a minor thing, but I just like the personalization. I'm on Day Two of my new Nook and so far I like it.

Update 6/14/15: So far, so good. The battery life is awesome. I do charge it every day but I really don't have to. I purchased a screen protector for it and am waiting for a cool decal skin and a case. I'm one who firmly believes in protecting their electronic gadgets.",4,True,"06 8, 2015"

They were paired with my iMac (Mountain Lion) and I suspected it might be a computer thing so I paired them with my iPhone and they sounded perfect.  I did a Google search and found a page where a guy discusses how he fixed the crackling sound he was getting out of his bluetooth speakers paired with OS X, so I tried it and it worked perfectly.

So if you're experiencing a crackling sound with your Mac, try this out:
{see comments - Amazon deletes links...}

Now that they're paired and the latency issue is fixed so far so good.  The range in my house isn't exactly 30 feet but I expected that.  I can safely go into the next room and be OK but beyond that it starts to cut out.  I can say that already I can feel my ears getting sore from the pressure these put on the back of them (been using them for nearly an hour now).  I'm sure I'll get used to that as I wear them more, but I deducted 1 star for the small cup size.  I wish it would fit around my whole ear.

If I were to point out any fault in these cables at all, it would be that the cable is fairly stiff and does not lend itself to tight bends. Fortunately for me, my applications do not require bends tighter than a 3"" radius. One might have an issue if they needed a 1"" radius bend very close to their equipment.

Alan C. Sims,"WIth this keyboard, you can type with the Ipad at many angles and in either verical or horizontal.  I like the keyboard and the easy Bluetooth pairing.  Having owned 7 prior keyboards, and returning them, I like this one the best.  The instructions do not say how you extend the keyboard to support your Ipad.  Update:  The instructions do cover this, I just missed it.

There is a horizontal depression at the rear of the keyboard.  Let your Ipad lay flat, the while holding onto the keyboard, use the depression to pull out the two metal supports.  You will then see two 'lips' that the bottom of your Ipad rests in.  You adjust viewing angles by pulling out the supports either fully or partially.  Fully extended is perfect for me.

You can rotate your Ipad to either vertical or horizontal positions.  Bluetooth connectivity worked the first time for me.  Read the instructions, first!  You can adjust the Ipad's brightness right from the keyboard.

The reason I didn't give this keyboard five stars is that there is no lighting of the keyboard itself.  If so, I haven't found it yet.  That is a glaring omission as I find it necessary in low light.  Yes, you can attach a LED light to illuminate the keyboard.  But, I prefer keyboard lighting from within.

The magnets in the earbuds are way too fun for me at times, but also convenient. Easy to keep the earbuds remotely tangle-free, and makes it easy to stick to say, the side of my metal desk at work if I want them within reach but out of the way.

Sound quality is fairly better than the HTC One M8's stock headset, the tips are more comfortable, but in the grand scale of things, I'd say a 7.5 out of 10 in general comfort.

Timothy D. Kennelly,"Between flights and all day meetings I have found I needed some battery back up as often AC wall jacks are not conveniently nearby or there is too much competition for them such as at airports. So, I looked for a portable power solution. There are a fair amount of choices, but I ended up selecting the New Trent iCarrier 12000mAh. Two features that caught my eye were the huge 12000mAh capacity and the double USB charging ports. My Droid Bionic cell and iPad Mini are the two devices I primarily wanted portable power for so the iCarrier needed to be Apple and it is. I can charge both the Droid and Mini simultaneously, multiple times at need and it will also charge my various other electrical devices such as iPhone, iPod Touch, bluetooth headphones, keyboards and various Kindles, etc. as well. I have found this battery to be outstanding! Considering the juice capacity it is quite light and compact. It has two USB ports labeled Output 1, Output 2, with Output 1 having a 2A output so that is the one to use for the Mini or other higher juice requiring devices like tablets. Output 2 produces 1A so can be used for most anything else that can be powered/recharged via USB. I did not see anything in the paperwork notating which port was which and they should address that. It doesn't come with an AC adapter for recharging, but on the plus side simply reversing the same standard USB cable used to charge most cells, Kindles, etc. works to charge the iCarrier. The power button is flush on the unit, but still can be accidently powered up and I would like to see the power up function work like the power down function which requires a prolonged press of the button. On the other hand unless it is connected to a device that needs charging the only power used while powered up is three small blue LEDs which of course draw very little power. These three LED give you a rough approximation of how much power is left in the iCarrier or how much more recharging it will need when doing that. The top LED stops blinking when it is fully recharged. There is a fourth LED that lights when it is powering or charging one of your devices and turns off when the device has been fully charged. The iCarrier itself has a battery saver feature that turns itself off after an amount of time after successfully fully charging whatever you have it connected to. I carry it in my briefcase or sling bag with a couple of cables depending on what I am doing and I don't worry about running out of juice anymore. As for cosmetically, it is a nice looking piece of hardware with a muted black matte sheen with blue accents. The finish minimizes fingerprint visibility although that is not a major consideration on this type of tool in my opinion. The fit, finish and materials appear to be of good workmanship. It is supposed to be good for approximately 500 charging cycles and that of course will only prove out with lots of time and use, but I don't see any reason not to believe that statement knowing the technology behind it. I fully approve and recommend the iCarrier. To the point I am thinking about purchasing a second. Not because I need a second, but for the future when this one uses up it's available lifespan. It seems whenever I find something I really, really like they discontinue the damn thing. LOL",5,True,"03 8, 2014"

Installing it on my Asus Maximus VIII Ranger was a cinch; I now have Windows 10 booting off of it - zero changes to BIOS settings and zero extra software added. Magician reports that I am getting x4 PCI Express lanes (some older motherboards support x2 only.) The M.2 format is great mechanically - nothing to mount in the drive bay, no pesky cables/much lower chance of connection failure. The card gets fastened with a  screw to the motherboard so it won't fall off even in an earthquake.

 - These print on the opposite side of the tape.  It surprised me when the words came out on the opposite side from what I was used to.  I thought it didn't work until I flipped it over.

In the end, I like this tape better.  It works well in my label maker.  It is less expensive.  The one ply design is more durable.  I've had the two ply separate sometimes, especially when wrapping the labels around hangars or cables.",5,True,"12 30, 2015"

SoyJames,"I just realized I've had these headphones for over a year now and decided they need their props.  No cable problems at all which I think is astounding, given my track record with wired headphones.  They've always sounded great.  I can wear them for almost eight hours at work without them getting too uncomfortable.  No noticeable damage or wear to any part.  (Possibly some slight discoleration on the headband denim from sebum).  Granted, they are sitting on my desk at work 90% of the time.  But they do get tossed loose into my bag for travel on some weekends.",5,False,"04 2, 2018"
Waldo Santiago,"Works great, but the speakers have to be the best feature. Loud and booming, and I don't even know how loud it gets after 20 because it is too loud.",5,True,"12 21, 2014"

Grandpa,"I stopped flying 14 years ago and had sold my other 10-30 headset. This was purchased when I returned to flying after my wife passed away last year. Reason for purchase - David Clark reputation, good price, and past experience with the same model. My only gripe is that this one did not come with a bag or case - as did my original one.",4,True,"10 5, 2011"

kriskezia,"For Canon 2L, this lens is nailed it! the portrait result i took was really sharp & clear. I preffered Canon 24-70 mm/2.8L but because it's so pricey so i had decided to choose this lens for less than $1000. I hope i wouldn't dissapointed having this lens for long time use.

The only thing i don't like is this lens is pretty heavy!",5,True,"12 19, 2012"

Amazon Customer,For the price it is an exceptional tv but my issue was i wanted a wired internet connection and this does not have an ethernet port for wired internet for netlfix so it tends to buffer a lot. However its probably the best smart tv for the price which it was nice to have the roku interface already on it.,3,True,"09 5, 2016"
Aloha State of Mind,This case is a great option to the very expensive Lifeproof or OtterBox.  I've used it for several months now and it still looks brand new.  It's very durable and does a great job of protecting the phone from the usual nicks and scratches that happen just from normal use.,5,True,"02 26, 2015"

Jennifer Quante,"Got one of these for my 11 year and and another for my 5 year old.  The folding is what keeps them from breaking.  My kids would snap head phones somehow on the part that connect the ear to the top band.  These fold right at the point so, so far so good.",5,True,"08 16, 2015"
R,Okay. So I waited before I wrote the review. I got cut off 3 times in one week. I saw a tv court show where someone won due to a dash cam. So we bought won. Liked it soooo much bought a mount for our backup car. I would like to know how to purchase another power cable in order to use in both cars. Buying an extra camera is not an option as we are on a fixed income.. Please let me know how to acquire this. Thanks in advance.,5,True,"03 2, 2018"

Daniel Goldman,"Very comfortable, and for listening they have been great -- I've fallen asleep with them on in bed and on planes, and they are very durable.  The sound is notably better than any of my other headphones as well.

However, they have been terrible for making phone calls.  People cannot hear me well - the microphones used in speaker phone built into the iPhone has much higher quality, and I end up not being able to use the Bose for call.",2,True,"06 26, 2015"
