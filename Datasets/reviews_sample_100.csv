Clayton Henry,"Are they kidding?  Now I've seen everything.  I am currently using an HDMI cable that my brother-in-law gave me.  He said they often toss them out at work because they're not worth the trouble to store them.  That's how cheap HDMI cables are...ALL OF THEM!  I defy anyone to show the difference in picture quality between a $1 and a $300 cable.  I once paid $20 for an HDMI cable a few years ago and now I feel stupid for doing so.  Anyone spending hundreds on these things needs to have their heads examined.  Don't do it, folks.",1,False,"11 6, 2009"
Vince G.,"Pros:
- Supergreat price
- The green LED is superb, v v ince
- Keys are essentially silent, would recommend for ninjas
- All keys function, including media/F keys
- There's a dragon on it that lights up how cool is that?? Answer: SUPREMELY
- Cord is braided, allowing for neat look and texture, as well as friction-free movement across wood, corners of desk, etc. [now if only my Anker ergonomic mouse was the same way]
- THERE'S A GOT-DANG CALCULATOR BUTTON, WHO THOUGHT OF THAT?? TAKE THAT, STATS HOMEWORK!

Meh:
- Enter key takes a bit to get used to
- Typing in general is a bit odd because rubber keys, but ya get used to it
- Spacebar doesn't always feel like it's being keyed
- 'Off' is one of the brightness levels, though the highest level is perfect imo
- Caps/Num/Win Lock lights are red and can't be modified in any way - in a way that's kindof a plus though, since you can see what's locked and what isn't without having to actual look at that sector of the keyboard. So I guess this line is superfluous

Cons:
- Spacebar and Backspace keys aren't fully lit [see pics]
- Would return for a hassle-free replacement, but then I'd be without a keyboard for several days :|",3,True,"10 28, 2016"

Benjamin Fugate,"I have two wireless Reolink IP cameras out in my disconnected garage. One looks at the driveway between the garage and the house, and gets a decent signal but the other is inside the garage and is constantly dropping out.

This powerline adapter was an awesome way for me to wire these cameras up to the rest of my system without having to bury new conduit or trying to put a repeater out there.

The cameras have been flawless ever since I installed this.

Only issue (not the adapters fault):
The signal strength indicator light on the powerline adapter does indicate the signal strength isn't great, however. The wiring out to the garage is all new romex and is on its own circuit with NO outlet in the basement, and the wiring in the basement is old rubber/cloth wiring for the most part on a different breaker. Despite this though the cameras work great (probably because they only use like 30mb/s) and I am in love with it.

Nevermindme,"Overall, this is a decent card but, it's not truly a single slot card. It's more like 1&1/2 (or simply 2) slot width. For most applications, not a problem. But, if your pci express slot is on the opposite side of most slots (with fan/heatsink faced upwards instead of hanging down) and that slot is right up against the top of your case...problems may arise.
  I solved my issues with some creativity and took it as a decent lesson in paying closer attention to the description, photos and reviews.
The other issue I have with the card is a barely noticeable, constant cricket noise coming off the fan. In most applications it probably would not be heard at all. (The card is basically unobstructed to the air at the top of my case)

  As for performance; it's pretty darn good. The hd radeon 6570 this card replaced had a hard time handling Borderlands 2 when things got crazy, and simply crashed when attempting to handle Skyrim. This GT 730 handles both just fine; except some rare moments in Borderlands 2 when the card is seriously pushed; which could simply be my aging computer rig (I also have the graphics set more towards quality rather than performance). So for me, this is a stop gap solution until I build a new rig. But as stop gaps go, it's pretty excellent.",3,True,"04 27, 2015"

Mark,"This is a really great wide field eyepiece. The first time I looked through it my statement was ""WOW, it's full of STARS!"". A good wide field eyepiece can give you stunning and inspiring views. Being 82 degrees the field of view is huge! It's sealed and argon filled making resistant to fogging and dust intrusion. That is a very nice feature. This eyepiece should give many years of trouble free use. At about $300 it's really a bargain for the quality you get. Both the look and feel of it shout quality. It's basically a copy of the much revered, loved, and expensive Televue Nagler 31mm design. The Nagler is considered by many to be the best eyepiece there is in this type of focal length. I would agree with that statement but this eyepiece is REALLY good and less than 1/2 the cost.

Paul Schwan,"After reading many of the earlier reviews I took the plunge and purchased the Canon VIXIA HF200 flash memory camcorder. I upgraded from a Canon mini-DV camcorder because I had purchased my first HDTV from Amazon last Christmas. Of course, I needed an HD camcorder with my new HD television!

I use a Sonnet 21-in-1 multimedia reader&writer Express Card/34 and pop the SD card in to transfer the video clips to my MacBook Pro. Using iMovie '09, this works great. iMovie '09 recognizes it without flaw, and with this software I can choose the clips I want to download from the SD card to my laptop. I use iMovie '09 to organize my videos, and I make the initial selections of clips that I want in each project using iMovie '09. Then, I export to Apple's Intermediate Codec and open this export file in iMovie HD. I prefer the timeline in Apple's older version of iMovie. I also purchased Final Cut Express 4, but haven't cracked that product yet, as it's much more complicated than what I'm used to in iMovie. So, for now, I'm bringing video clips in with the latest version of iMovie, then downconverting and editing in iMovie HD; this works great. I'll eventually learn Final Cut Express and move forward in my video editing hobby. I share all of this because I didn't realize until I read in David Pogue's Missing Manual book (iMovie '09 and iDVD) that I could still use iMovie HD with a flash memory video camera and the AVCHD codec. I'm glad to have discovered this.

As others have said, getting AVCHD encoded video clips into a computer takes LONGER than real-time because of the converting that must take place. My mode of operation with a Canon mini-DV camcorder was to fill a 60-minute tape, then transfer it to the laptop when convenient. I would get it started and come back 60 minutes later to 60-minutes of video ready to edit. Now, I come back 90 minutes later instead. Transfer seems to take about 1.5 times the length of the clips, give or take. For me, this is not a problem when I use my usual transfer and edit process.

If you're looking for instantaneous transfer of files in useable form, though, flash memory won't give it to you -- at least with this camera. Others have stated, and I found directions in David Pogue's book stating that it's possible to transfer the files to the computer's hard drive for LATER conversion to useable form for editing. I haven't done this yet, and I would be nervous about deleting the clips from my flash memory card until I had them converted, could see them, and had them backed up on another hard drive. That's when I clear the flash card and re-use it for new video clips. I've had too many lost data situations in the past and I guess I'm a bit overly cautious when I have once-in-a-lifetime video that I don't want to lose. I believe in multiple copies of precious data, video data included. I get around this limitation by having two 16 Gb flash memory cards which, in best mode on this camera, gives me about 1.5 hours of video per card. I have yet to fill one before transferring video.

I also have multiple firewire and/or USB hard drives which I use for backing up video. If I take a long trip I'll just buy a handful of SD chips, along with the two batteries I already own, and shoot away. Each evening it's my practice to download to hard drive anyway, back that up to an external drive, and this seems to work for most situations. It's less expensive to do this with mini-DV tapes (which provide one backup source), but when precious video is involved I don't mind paying for a few extra 16 Gb chips. They're pretty inexpensive on Amazon.com.

I recommend this camera if your habits fit mine, or if you're looking for great-looking video on an HDTV. I have a lot to learn about this camera to get the most out of it, including the editing process. It will serve me for many years to come, as did my Canon mini-DV standard-definition camera.

APRIL 10, 2010 UPDATE:
I've received many nice comments and questions via Amazon, so many that I decided it might be helpful to create a video to show how I move video from a memory chip to my MacBook Pro laptop. If you're a Mac user you might find this helpful. I use iMovie 9 and this tutorial explains the process using that software.

J. K. Tappe,"I bought a pair of these in advance of a 10,000-mile round trip vacation that involved 8 airline flights.  As a seasoned traveller, I'm all too well versed in trying to crank up a walkman, computer, or other audio device to try to drown out the noise of the engines, other passengers, beverage carts, etc.  And if you crank up a conventional set of headphones, you end up with ringing ears and temporary hearing loss after such prolonged abuse of your eardrums.
Enter these in-ear ""bud style"" headphones.  They block environmental noise like earplugs and then send their output into the now quieted environs of your ear canal.  This lets you not only use a lower volume setting on your device but the sound you hear is much less cluttered.  I'm writing this review to say they work every bit as well as I'd hoped when I bought them.  The aircraft noise was muted to a distant hum and I was able to hear every guitar string of the songs I listened to and every footstep in the movies I played on my PowerBook.  There were literally times when I found myself looking around the airplane cabin for a strange noise I'd heard, only to figure out it was a sound effect in the film I was playing.  I'm serious--the sound was that good!
Even when my batteries ran out, I kept these headphones in my ears as earplugs as I read a book.  Many headphones cause pain after prolonged use; they cut off blood circulation or simply induce pressure which can lead to headaches or earaches until they are removed.  Not these.  They come with three different size rubber cups that you can try to find which one fits you best. And because they are rubber, not foam, they are easy to clean and also do not require any ""pre-squishing"" like other products.
In quick response to a previous reviewer who claimed these had no bass, that is the result of improper use.  These cannot be ""set"" in your outer ear like conventional mini headphones--they must be pushed into your ear canal so they can create a seal.  Think of them as earplugs, not headphones.  Once you put them in properly, the bass response is quite astounding.
The only possible downside (if you can call it that) to these headphones is their size--they're so small they are easy to lose when not in use.  I did misplace mine for a few months and was ready to buy another set before the originals were found.  I never even considered a diffferent product I was so pleased with these.  I've wholeheartedly recommended them to all my friends and will continue to do so.",5,False,"01 13, 2004"

Jimme,"Read the entire review for the reasons I gave only 3 stars rather than 5. I got a taste for ChromeOS by installing CloudReady on an old laptop and decided to jump in the pool and buy a real Chromebook. I'll always be skeptical and paranoid as to what happens with my data in the cloud with Google but I just won't store anything online that would embarrass my Grandmother.

The back-lit keyboard is a feature that lead me to the Toshiba over other Chromebooks. I am not a typist and have to look at the keyboard so the back-lit keys are an important feature for me. Also, the overall appearance, 1080p display and Intel i3 processor are features that appealed to me. Unfortunately after I bought it I have found there is no DEL key nor a Caps Lock key. Being a Windows user I also miss the Home/End keys as well. So far that is the only negative aspect about the Chromebook I have found so far.

It was extremely easy to set up. Since I work in IT, I know getting Windows up and running can be time consuming and I have no experience buying a WinTel box from retail. In my experience the Chromebook was a pleasure to get up and running. Since I had tried CloudReady my Google account was set up and made logging in to the Chromebook a breeze. There was no prompt for Anti virus software, no prompt for system updates, the Chromebook was ready to use in about 5 minutes.

With very few exceptions all my computing is done on the Internet. If I have no Internet access I have no reason to use a computer. That said, the Internet connection speed is directly related to the online experience of the Chromebook as it is with the other operating systems. At the office this morning the 20/40 Mbs down/up speed was joyous. By the middle afternoon the connection dogged down to 5/2 Mbs down/up and this was reflected in the Chromebook's performance; not as joyous. At home I get 15/1 Mbs down/up using DSL and the Chrombook's performance was just shy of stellar. For me personally, I like to have a minimum of 10/1 Mbs down/up for online activity.

The IPS screen is fantastic! At 1080p the video appearance is on par with a good TV; Images are crystal clear. I've had this for a over a month now and am still being impressed with this small workhorse. When a website displays slowly on my WinTel box, I switch to the Chromebook and it easily outperforms the web page display speed. It seems to be at least twice as fast.

When the Toshiba Chromebook is opened, it turns on. Doh! Brilliant idea and implementation. I agree that when I open my Chromebook I intend to power it on so why not have it turn on when the cover is opened?  Another item of note is that the power brick runs only mildly warm. This is the only power brick I have encountered that does not heat up beyond just warm to the touch. The laptop can rest securely on my legs at up to at least about a 30 degree angle and not slip. This is due to the rough plastic bottom of the case. Every laptop should have a rough bottom so they stay put.

The browsing experience, saving to the SSD and video streaming are smooth and fast! From past experience with Intel's Atom processor I went big and got the Intel i3 for the quickest performance possible and I am very happy with that decision. Other reviews have stated the i3 may not be worth the extra $100 but I wanted to be sure I got the fastest performance possible.

From 5 stars down to three. OK, so there are some downsides. Mostly the Track pad because it feels rough to the touch and after five minutes of swiping my finger it begins to feel a little numb. After a couple of months I have to say I think the track pad is by far the worst I've touched and I have swiped every single laptop on display at Best Buy and the Toshiba is the only track pad that feels rough to the touch. Because of this rough feel I have opted to use a mouse and that greatly reduces portability for me. Yes you can drag a mouse around but...  The keyboard and track pad are the true primary human interfaces with any laptop. If these components are lacking it reflects on the entire device and user experience. For this reason alone I deducted 1.5 stars. Also, the fit of the case is needing attention due to a bit of overhang of the top that creates a somewhat sharp edge, especially on the right [side of my laptop]. This poor fit makes the laptop feel cheaply constructed. Because a very well manufactured case adds to the cost I deducted only .5 star.

Overall a very good Chromebook that I can recommend to anyone seeking a lower cost alternative to Mac's or Wintel laptops as long as they can live with a sandpaper-like track pad and less than excellent fit and finish. The star rating can be somewhat misleading. My thought is that it is actually more than OK but the track pad always leave me wondering if I would enjoy a different model Chromebook more if my fingers did not go numb each time it's used.

Mickey71,"I bought this at a local retail store and really liked it.  The problem was, that when I opened the package, the repair fluid had leaked into the accessory area in the back of the unit.  The repair fluid tube appeared to be sealed, but it came right out of the bottom of the tube where it is supposed to be crimped and sealed.  I was worried that the fluid leaked inside the unit and might have damaged the motor.  I decided to give it a try and see how I liked it before exchanging the unit.  It worked VERY well, so I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another unit.  When I got home and opened the package, I found the exact same problem with the repair fluid.  Soooo, back to the store I went, although this time, I insisted that the store open the package before I left.  They again found the exact same problem with the repair fluid tube.  After having tried 3 packages of the same model, I gave up and decided to exchange it for a different brand.  I don't remember the name of the second brand, but it only cleaned 3 discs before I hear an awful sound and the unit stopped spinning the disc.  It spun fine as long as there wasn't a disc in the unit, but when I added a disc, it made terrible noises.  So I returned that one as well and finally tried the Memorex OptiFixPro.  In my opinion, the Memorex doesn't do anything to really fix discs at all;  it just cleans them.  I will be returning the Memorex unit and I will call Maxell Customer Service to see if they can do anything to ensure I get a unit that doesn't have the leakage problem.

To summarize, I have now tried 3 different brands of disc repair kits and this one does the best job of repairing discs.  Also, I liked that the unit allowed me to clean one disc on one side of the unit while simultaneously repairing a second disc on the opposite side.  I have not found any other repair kit that allows two discs at once.  However, I think that Maxell had some quality control issues or manufacturing issues that allowed these units to be sent out with leaking repair fluid tubes, so I would definitely recommend that you only but this unit from a respectable retailer that allows exchange or refund without hassles in case you encounter this same problem (and be aware that with some retailers, you may need to pay shipping charges to send the unit back for exchange).",4,False,"12 2, 2007"

V. nicholas,"i work on a talk show at a radio station, so sound is a huge thing for me. i have this mp3 playa always plugged into my tv. its super easy. they give u a cable. one end goes into the tv's headphone port, and the other end goes into the bottom of the mp3 player. its decent quality and just an all around easy, quick process to turn tv sound into mp3s.

one option i turned off was ""sync track"". sync track basically starts recording when an audio signal comes down the line. but the downside is that a lot of time youll miss the first second or two of the audio you want, especially when its the transition b/w the end of a commercial and the beginning of the program and theres black screen and dead silence for a few seconds. and line sync cuts off recording when the audio signal ends. so if you're like me, and you're rewinding and fast forwarding your tivo around like crazy getting to the right spot, you're gonna have about 20 2 or 3 second long mp3s when u finally are ready to edit. put it simply, its a big pain, so just turn sync track OFF.

ive had this for about 6 months. i get tons of audio from it. i pull sound from 60 minutes, saturday night live, the office, letterman. i could grab something from a dvd i suppose, but i haven't tried that yet. the quality isn't top notch, but it is coming out of the headphone jack and i do have an on-the-cheap-side 20 inch lcd tv. but it does a great job for what i need, and i have no complaints.",5,True,"12 7, 2006"

I contacted SanDisk technical support and was asked to run an application that measured average transfer speed. It was shown as 9MB/s for writes. They claim that this is normal and would not do anything more. A class 10 card should have a minimum streaming speed of 10MB/s.

This is a well constructed and very good case.  It could have a better area on the side to attach a separate lens case similar to the Lowepro. If you want a bag to carry an SLR with a zoom lens or smaller this will work perfectly. Using a Canon T1i with a 55 - 250 lens fits perfectly - small lens hood makes it tight, but it fits. Quality construction, only wish it had attachable lens holders for the side and it would be perfect. Love the thick rubber bottom. Easy to carry and access the camera (for an amateur photographer)",4,False,"08 28, 2010"

Andre Viens,"I bought this because my cable TV connection was on the other side of the room from where I had the TV. As a temporary solution, I ran a long coax wire around and up over door thresholds to get the connection to the TV. Then I heard about these HDMI wireless transmitters and receivers and wanted to give it a shot. This has exceeded my expectations for ease of use! I just literally plugged it in per the instructions and it worked. No problems, no issues. I'm able to use the IR blaster at the transmitter side to echo everything received from the TV.

Only minor negative is that when you first turn the cable box or TV on, it takes a little bit of time to sync up and start receiving video (perhaps five seconds or so).

This would be most ideal for people who mount their TV over their fireplace or some place out in the open but don't know what to do with all their TV equipment (cable box, DVD player, AV receiver, etc).",5,True,"10 2, 2016"

Z. Freeman,"Obviously, when we're talking about speakers in this price range no one is expecting room-shaking power or superb quality. These little Logitech speakers don't offer either of those but what they lack in power they make up for in portability and compact design. The best feature here is that these speakers don't need to be plugged into the wall to work; they function off of power from the computer via a USB connection. The cables are not very long (again they're meant to be portable) and can be easily wrapped around the back of the speaker. It would have been nice for the speaker that both cables are attached to to have a bit more space to wrap cables (since the other speaker doesn't need as much) but this is a minor issue.

They don't get super loud but they get loud enough to justify using external speakers vs. the built in computer functionality and the volume knob is easy to use.

Additionally, where most computer speakers are black, these are white. This actually makes them pretty ideal for a Mac as they look like they are part of the laptop package.

I would recommend these more for a laptop than for a desktop. There are plenty of better quality speakers for a little bit more if you plan to leave the speakers in one place. But for ease of transporting, these are pretty ideal.",4,False,"08 21, 2011"

David R.,"The Sony bluetooth transmitter has range almost equal to that of my iMac's bluetooth transmitter. It works with my iPhone but I have to bring up my iPod player and then plug the transmitter into the iPhone and then press the on/off button on the transmitter. It puts up a message that it's not compatible with the iPhone but just answer ""no"" when it asks about going to airplane mode (it works in airplane mode too, as it should). By answering no you can make and receive phone calls seamlessly and the iPod mutes and pauses appropriately. I use Sony headphones (DR-BT21G) during running, walking, working out, and house cleaning. I use a Plantronics Voyager 855 headset when driving. The Sony headset is the best of the two for iPod audio quality and phone call quality.",4,True,"03 24, 2009"

The openings on the side and back match perfectly the Kindle's camera, volume and speakers. You DO NOT have to lift up the Kindle to take pictures as some reviewers pointed out. If you secure the Kindle with the Velcro strap that is provided it does fit like a glove. It includes the pen/pointer and it does have a place for it unlike other models. I also found the price to be very reasonable compared to other cases. Overall, I am very pleased with this I-Blason case and highly recommend it.",5,True,"04 7, 2014"
